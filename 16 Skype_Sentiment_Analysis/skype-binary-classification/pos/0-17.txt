It is truly sad to see what has happened to skype since Microsoft acquired it . Years ago there were some connection quality issues caused by very variable data-connection-quality ( not skype's fault ) . Now there is just a merry-go-round of patches and up ( down ? ) grades with each release becoming less good than it's predecessor . At the moment I cannot get any notification of receiving messages and my calls randomly drop out - only reestablishing 70% of the time . My contacts' status indications are rarely accurate . Despite having a 28-50Mb connection . Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves . I am now going to have to move to WhatsApp - which I have resisted for a couple of years , but now my 'experience has been improved' in Skype to the point that I give in .
