The Nest Best Thing to Being There
We enjoy being able to visit and see our son , daughter-in-law and two youngest grandsons . We live so far apart and do not get together very often . So , seeing them is especially important . Since it is free , it is even better . Thanks Skype for all the hours of enjoyment you have given us .
