It is by far worst video chat â€¦
It is by far worst video chat application ever made . I have it installed on two Nexus 7 tablets , Nexus 6P phone and two Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 and S3 tablets . Also valrious PCs ( Win 7 and 10 ) and Mac . Interface is different on each device . It is hard to explain to older people ( my parrents ) every time Skype team makes change to interface and they have no clue where to find contacts anymore but Skype offers them tons of different things that are completely useless for most of the people . I'm done with that crap . There are better alternatives . At least Hangouts looks same on all systems including Windows PCs , Macs , tablets and phones .
