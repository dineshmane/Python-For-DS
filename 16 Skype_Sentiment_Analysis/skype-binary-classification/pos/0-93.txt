The worst programme ever ?
One of the worst programmes I have ever had . Skype couple years ago use to be a simple tool for calling and they were good at it ! Now its slow , not working , complicated , unreliable , integrated system that I recommend not to use . The invoicing system ? Ridiculous . If you wanna contact somebody ? You cannot , you only get automated messages . . . Once my license is done , I erase , delete , ban skype from my PC and life . btw . world unlimited calling to 63 destinations is pure lie as you can only call to 8 mobile lines .
