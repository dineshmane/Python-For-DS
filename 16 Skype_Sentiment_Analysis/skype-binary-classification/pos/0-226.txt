To be honest the new Skype Version 8 . x is horrible it looks unclear and confusing . Before it was easy and instant to see which groups are active and actual , which users are online or away , text was easy to read for eyes . Now everything is overcomplex and filled with unnecessary text . Graphics and Colors and fonts are completely chaotic and disturbing while reading . It really seems the new microsoft era is : buying tech companies and distroy them . Same happened with " Microsoft Phone aka Nokia " . How can you change a software in a way that i get so uggly and unpracticable that clients will not gonna use it anymore . It seems they hire outranged Google and Apple guys to make their application look modern and fancy but MS Managers are too incompetent to understand : if you hire bad people ( even if they have 10 PhDs ) they will completely distroy even stable working MS software . Secondly if you hire cheap fresh IT students and put them into work teams they will distroy your last working software aswell ( see skype 8 . X ) ! To the Management : How can you accept a dev . Team to change a major product in a way that is looses their entire userfriendly interface ? If they are not doing a 180° turn around it seems to me its time to start alternative solutions . Im 99% sure most of the skype clients will agree on the fact MS is loosing a lot of skype users and activity if they are not able to get the 180° turn and change the software as it was at Version 7 . X !
