Probably the worst software application Iâ€™ve ever used
Skype 8 is a dreadful redesign of an application that in previous versions basically worked although it was never the same once Microsoft took it over . To say it has been dumbed down would be an understatement . Many things that used to work no longer do . Where is my chat history going back years ? Why is searching within chat windows useless ? Why does hovering emojis not show the shortcut anymore ? Why does pasting an image into a chat window immediately deliver it without the failsafe need to press Enter first ? An utterly appalling application that will hopefully be resigned to the scrap heap in the next few years as tools such as the infinitely superior Slack gain more traction .
