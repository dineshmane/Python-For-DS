Skype keeps me connected
I moved away from my family from TX to HI and have been using Skype video calls to keep in contact and let my 2 year old nephew get to know me . I can only make a trip out to TX once a year so having him know my face is a really big deal for me . I also use Skype to talk to my boss and co-workers when working on projects . It helps me co-ordinate and get my questions answered faster than email would .
