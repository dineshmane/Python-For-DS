Fraud activity that Skype didn't want to deal with !
I had a fraud activity on my account and reported it to Skype . First of all , it takes " years " to reach a customer representative via email , second of all when you finally reach them , representatives start playing a ping-pong email game , third they told me that i did have a fraud activity on my account and said that they will transfer to a different department that will take care of my case and will give me my money back . Two weeks passed and nothing happened . I keep contacting Harold G . who was helping me with my case and he just simply doesn't answer . I decided to contact my bank and let them take care of it . I am disappointed with Skype and deleted my account and application from everywhere . Don't want to deal with unprofessionals . Such a big company and doesn't know how to take care of its customers . SHAME !
