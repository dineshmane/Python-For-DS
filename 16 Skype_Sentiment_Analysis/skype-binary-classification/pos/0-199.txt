Microsoft does not care
This version of skype has zero customization , and the interface is ugly as sin . This version also no longer allows for window conversations to pop out so you can only do one conversation at a time . Honestly they are killing skype faster than they are fixing it . This latest update is clearly a sign of a company that no longer cares about the quality of their program nor stability and usability . Their just doing what they want and we have to scream as loud as we can at them to get them to listen . If they had to only use their own products they would feel the same way we do , it would be hell in their offices . I bet any of them use discord or some other app , so all in all I give this program as it is a 1 star rating . Use skype classic if they do not threaten it's existence with a set expiry date again like whining children not getting their way . Before you try to change the program fix it and fix what is wrong then work on making it look how you want . If you can't fix what you broke , then why bother ? Fix the contract list issues , fix the chat history issue , fix the lack of customization , fix the program and then make sure we are happy as well as YOU ARE .
