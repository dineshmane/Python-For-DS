Will not be renewing my subscription
I am a paid subscriber and have been with Skype for several years . I am a desktop user . When Skype 8 came out I kept switching back to Skype 7 because version 8 was terrible . No individual chat windows , no customizable hot keys , could not resize the text input area , no font choices like font face and size . They eventually rolled out split window but only for the huge clunky windows 10 app and not for the desktop version . Finally they forced users clinging to their fully functional version 7 into the terrible version 8 which lacks so many features of version 7 that it's not an " upgrade " at all it's a serious downgrade . They are not listening to the users who have voted highly on Uservoice for either the return of version 7 or to add the missing features into the version 8 desktop client ( not the app ) . This is unacceptable for people who paid for the service and for people who use this product for work and cannot get usual tasks done because some of the features they rely heavly upon have been removed .
