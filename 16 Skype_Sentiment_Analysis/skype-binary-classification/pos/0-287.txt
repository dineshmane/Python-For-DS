Been using Skype for years . .
Been using Skype for years . . . unfortunately the new design is not good enough to warrant my continued use . I loved the old skype , but I see now that you can't even keep that around . . . so I'm taking the consequense and uninstalling . DId not believe I could leave without leaving a message about it though . . . so here we go . . . Hope that it will change at some point . @Skype why do you not listen to your users ?
