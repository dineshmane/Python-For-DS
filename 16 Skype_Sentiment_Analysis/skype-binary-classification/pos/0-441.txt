I would give 0 stars if I could
I would give 0 stars if I could . I was a Skype user for more than 10 years , until I was locked out of my account , simply because I got a new laptop and my old one was dead , so I couldn't access the account through that . I had not forgotten my password , but didn't have access to the old email I had used when I originally signed up . I was send through an incredibly cumbersome verification process , asking for information from when I first signed up , as I said more than 10 years ago . I provided credit card and payment info that was correct and my security word . I did this on my own at least 3 times and was denied access every time . I finally chatted with someone from the support team for almost 1 . 5 hours and it was an absolutely horrible experience and complete waste of my time . I was asked to do the same thing over and over again to recover my account , even though I explained from the start that I had tried that multiple times . It never worked and the guy didn't try to find any other way of solving the issue , just saying it can't be done . I have a balance on the account and he would not even give me a refund . My money is basically being stolen . The account recovery process is completely ridiculous , asking for information from more than 10 years ago and security words being " not enough " . According the to the guy I chatted with , there is no way to send me a recovery link , besides through that process . It's hard to believe a technology company has no real way to troubleshoot a technical problem . Skype obviously doesn't care about a customer who had used the service for more than 10 years and paid hundreds of dollars in that period . This is completely unacceptable .
