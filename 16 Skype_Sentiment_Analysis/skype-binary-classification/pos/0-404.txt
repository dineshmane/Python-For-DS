Poor Services ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Decided to write a review for skype , why skype is unreliable these past few weeks ? I am not able to receive LOTS OF IMPORTANT MESSAGES , at first I thought my contacts were just away or just busy doing stuffs , until they message me on viber that they receive my messages and they answer back , but unfortunately , it's not going through my skype , you what , I mess a lot in my work last week because of this unreliable app , now my team will decide to change our communication app to much more reliable , maybe team viewer will be the option for now . !
