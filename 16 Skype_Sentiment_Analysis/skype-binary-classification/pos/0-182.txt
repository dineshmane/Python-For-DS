It seems redesigned by a phone onlyâ€¦
It seems redesigned by a phone only freaking addict to social texting . Don't you know " Windows " made windows because of the ability to have several " windows " with different content at a time ? ! ! ! I understand the new skype focuses on mobiles . But it at least give the chance to the user to configure if it wants the old multi windows style in the desktop application . Having multiple chats now , is ridiculous annoying . Before you can even have all the windows on screen . Now , back , find , forth , check , confuse , . . . awful . And what happen with the " Away " status . So handy . Of course , now they assume you keep your phone with you all the time . Well , guess what , I can not keep my desktop with me all the time ! Since I am a developer it is connected to lot of stuff and It won't fit in a backpack .
