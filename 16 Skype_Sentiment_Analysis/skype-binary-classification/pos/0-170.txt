Skype has become totally stupidified
I have been using Skype for years , which has grown to become a cornerstone for my work . Skype 8 killed all of that with one well-aimed blow . Where to start ? Essential features are still missing ( advanced status control , multiple chat windows , adding phone numbers to contacts , compact view , searching within messages , etc ) . I find the user interface downright ugly , with bizarre colors and sounds , and is confusing to navigate . Hey , the interface does not even follow Microsoft's own guidelines for the equally ugly UWP system . Last , Skype has gained stupid features such as highlights and stickers - STICKERS ? ! - in order to copy other chat tools . There are some positive new features , such as the media gallery , but this is only really needed if you somehow fail to organize downloaded data on your computer . Skype used to stand out for its sleek , simple , and elegant experience . Now it has been reduced to look like one of many , at the cost of essential functionality . Microsoft , what where you thinking ?
