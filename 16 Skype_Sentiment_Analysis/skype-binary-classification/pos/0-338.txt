Getting worse and worse
In the past couple of years , Skype has been upgrading and changing its look without any actual chat quality improvements . I am asked to create a new login , my picture was automatically taken from Gmail instead of using my old Skype photo etc . All these updates are making Skype worse and complicated . I am going to use a software that stays the same ( unless there are MAJOR improvements ) or I am going to look for another form of communication . Poor quality , Skype !
