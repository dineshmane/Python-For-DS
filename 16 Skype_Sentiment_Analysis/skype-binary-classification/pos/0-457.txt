My solid old iphone 4s ( usable in all respects prior to this upgrade ) can no longer use Skype . Skype is a messaging platform and there is no reason why a phone such as this cannot run a simple messaging program . Microsoft have simply decided to make a new app and then restrict access to older versions . Have tried the 'zany' new social media makeover on another Android phone and it makes the application rather horrible to use for a traditional user that simply wants to transfer a message . In addition , the installation of the new app turned my status to online , whereas it has always been set to 'invisible' - I am not impressed . I have decided to transfer my usage to whatsapp , all my phones , desktops , the lot , my whole family . Surprised and annoyed .
