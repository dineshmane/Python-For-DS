Horrible new update - Skype ruins business customers
this is impossible . It used to be a tool for business calls and chats . Now it looks like Facebook chat . Makes me sick . An absolutely horrible update which I was forced to install because the old version refused to run on my Macbook and required an update . Sucks big time .
