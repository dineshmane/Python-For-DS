Extraordinarily inefficient
Extraordinarily inefficient , badly run and unhelpful . Skype seems to have gone to the dogs since Microsoft got involved - they don't respond to any requests for help and they make it almost impossible for you to sign in and use their services conveniently , though they are of course only too happy to take your money . Altogether appalling customer service - much like their parent company Microsoft who claimed to have lost all of my emails and who then spent over 45 hours on the phone with me trying to persuade me that yes they could restore them , but failed utterly .
