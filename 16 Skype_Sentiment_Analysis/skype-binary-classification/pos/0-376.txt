What new Skype ?
It is so bad , I am considering canceling my paid subscription . You cannot even add new contact from calls you just made . I'm looking for an alternative . Anybody know of one ? I'm willing to accept lower voice quality just so I don't have to deal with the " new Skype interface " .
