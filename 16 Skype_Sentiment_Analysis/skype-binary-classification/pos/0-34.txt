How awful is the new Skype ?
How awful is the new Skype ? I cannot count the ways . Old version worked beautifully Whenever I was running low in my " wallet , " I simply topped up and carried on as usual . Now I have to " Subscribe . " Internal applications have been moved all over the place in counterintuitive ways . If I ran my business with the tone deafness and utter arrogance of Microsoft , I would be out of business within a week . Millions of users have complained on message boards , and the response of the M$ moderators is to say , " Your concerns have been noted , " and promptly lock the thread . I used ooVoo for other users with ooVoo and found it worked incredibly well for users for all over the world , and Skype for international calls for people not on the app . Remember King Midas ? Everything he touched turned to gold . Well , think of Microsoft as the mirror image of King Midas . Everything it lays its hands on turns to , well , do the math , dear reader , do the math .
