ARRRGGGHHHHHHH ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
So logged on to my Skype today and came up with a " set-up your account " window from Microsoft ( like . . waaat ? ! ) It went to hell in a hand-basket from there ! I gamely went ahead with it . . . following all the prompts and inputs . . . and in the end the wheels churned and the bells rang and it spat out what I can only describe as a really bad joke onto my screen ! I almost puked ! ALL MY SKYPE CONTACTS AND SAVED PHONE NUMBERS . . . GONE ! ! ! ! I USE SKYPE FOR MY BUSINESS YOU DUMB F*****S ! ! ! YOU HAVE SERIOUSLY SCREWED UP ! AND THEN A LIST OF MY EMAIL CONTACTS ARE THROWN IN MY FACE WITH THE INVITATION TO " ADD TO MY SKYPE CONTACTS " . WTH WOULD I WANT MY HOTMAIL CONTACTS ( most of them old and outdated ) ADDED TO MY SKYPE THAT I USE TO PHONE WORK COLLEAGUES ON AROUND THE WORLD . EMAIL CONTACTS FOR EMAIL AND SKYPE CONTACTS FOR PHONING/TEXTING WHAT PART OF THAT DON'T YOU GUYS GET ? ! You effin' dumb-asses have REALLY messed it up this time ! The old Skype was perfect for what it was . . . why the hell are you trying to compete with FB messenger , which is a social contact app . . . A TOY . . . ! ! THE OLD SKYPE HAD FEATURES THAT WERE REALLY USEFUL AND WORKED AND WAS WELL-ORGANIZED AND HELD ALL MY PHONE CONTACTS . NOW IT'S ALL GONE ! ! ! YOUR NEW DOWN-GRADED SKYPE IS A PIECE OF USELESS GARBAGE ! ! I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAD TO GIVE YOU ONE STAR JUST SO I COULD WRITE THIS REVIEW ! IF I COULD GIVE YOU A BIG FAT ZERO , I WOULD DO THAT . . ! ! THERE MUST BE A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL RESERVED FOR YOU MORONS !
