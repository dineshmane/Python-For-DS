What a shame
What a shame . Skype used to be one of the major pillars of the internet . Now Microsoft have made it look like the work of a 6 year old kid who has never used Skype before and just wanted to fill the screen with useless garbage while disabling most of the original Skype features . No tools , no camera settings no Skype sounds control , no full screen , terrible messaging , etc . etc . RIP Skype .
