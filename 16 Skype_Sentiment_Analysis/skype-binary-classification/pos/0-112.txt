Absolutely horrible
Absolutely horrible . Skype lags all of the time , and also kills my broadband connection whenever a video call comes in . I only know of an incoming call when it fails . Using the search field crashes the app half the time , and the other half it's so painfully slow it's not worth using . The new UI is horrible . This app has failed fantastically on so many levels I wonder if Microsoft is just secretly wanting to kill this business area for themselves by making the program such a complete PITA to use . It's really difficult to fail this thoroughly without trying .
