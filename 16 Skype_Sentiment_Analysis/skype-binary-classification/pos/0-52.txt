Very , very poor Skype
Very , very poor Skype ! I have persevered for over a year with constant updates and log in verification issues . It is absolute pants . The final straw is now it won't log in for me at home and my parent's version is the same with too many updates and log in refusals . I will now look for a simpler product with fewer features that does not need to log in at all !
