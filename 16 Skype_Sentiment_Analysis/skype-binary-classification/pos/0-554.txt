Kick Ass for Long Distance Family and Work Calls
I use Skype for both personal and business needs . I especially love the fact that I can screen-share while working with a trainee or one of my fellow contractors . The video chat comes in handy when the kiddos want to chat with relatives that aren't local . . . . and sometimes even the local ones ! I really don't have anything negative to say . I suppose I would like a " mark as un-read " option for some of my work dialogue , but that's not too big of a deal .
