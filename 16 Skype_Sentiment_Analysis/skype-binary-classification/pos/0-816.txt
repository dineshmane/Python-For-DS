Bring us Together
I first discovered Skype about 4 years ago and signed up when line rental cost more than my phonecalls ! Skype has allowed me to see my family from the other side of the world , show them round my new house , introduce the " grandchild " - our Malamute and take part in a Christmas Eve tradition I would have otherwise missed . The services offered , the quality of the connections and the fact that mostly it's free is awesome ! Thanks for getting us together Skype - nice one !
