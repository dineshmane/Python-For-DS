Video call ? Oh if only !
I have always been a keen MSN user and have had no troube using the MSN video chat feature . The latest update of MSN indicates a " merge " with Skype , forcing me to have a Skype account ( oh goodie ! ) . So I tried my brand spanking new Skype system to have a much needed catch up with my long distance boyfriend . Skype was VEEERRRYYYY slow . Infact I had to cease all other activities in order for it to open properly . Then came the much awaited video call . . . . . . or an attempt at it . I saw more " slow connection " " connection error " messages than I did of my partners face . The connection was the worst I have ever experienced . I decided to close down the amazing new Skype and recall via the MSN messenger - which suprisingly had no trouble what so ever delivering a successful video call . My mysterious connection problems seemed to disappear , so the problem is with Skype . Not a great first experience really . It was like using dial up !
