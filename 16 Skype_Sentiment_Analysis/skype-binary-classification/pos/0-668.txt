Absolutely no customer service .
I really liked the skype until my account was hacked by someone in Russia . Luckily , I caught it before they racked up too much , under $100 , but despite all of my efforts I could not get in touch with any type of customer service from skype . I just wanted to make sure this would never happen again , but they obvsiouly had no interest in helping their customers , even when they are the victim . I will never use skype again for this reason . I cannot trust a company that will allow my information to be hacked and then provide no customer service to console me .
