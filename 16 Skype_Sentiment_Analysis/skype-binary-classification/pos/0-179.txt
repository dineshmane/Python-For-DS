Microsoft , please give us Skype back !
I used Skype for many years to communicate with my freelancers and clients . But Microsoft managed to incrementally destroy all the usefulness of this wonderful software . Bloated it with unnecessary frills and embarrassing colors the new interface is reacting slow and laggy . The service got extremely unreliable , not sending messages for hours . Recently i saw an old version of Skype running on a computer and felt this deep pain inside my heart , like you feel when you lost someone . I was not aware how painful it can be to loose a piece of software . Software i am using for hours each day . If by chance somebody from MS reads this message , i politely ask to remove all the " design " from Skype and make it a real , stalwart tool & service again . People are leaving Skype in droves , migrating to other services like slack because they just can not work with it anymore . If i would be MS i would rather have invested in the screen sharing experience ( like adding a mouse pointer or some interactivity ) than adding useless kitsch .
