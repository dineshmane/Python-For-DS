Worst Skype version ever !
Microsoft , what are you doing ? Those who launched this , don't use Skype , do they ? It's a terrible version . It lacks possibility to customize it or set it up , and this on top of a very bad UI . Just few examples : - You don't go away automatically , when you are off ( not even such status exists ) . - No more compact vs complete view . The pseudo compact view takes 1/3 of my screen + you need to click at least twice ! to change the screen from one contact to another ( as you need to go through the main list ) . - Chat notification is a complete mess . I could continue , but you got the point . Honestly , I'm giving this star , because I cannot write a review without it !
