I used to love Skype but then Skype 8â€¦
I used to love Skype but then Skype 8 came to the picture . I grew up with the Skype experience and it got deeply rooted in my day-to-day activities . However , with the newest version , the classic program got stripped out of its previous functionality , and the design got altered ( to some extent better , to other - worse ) . Notifications are terrible , split view is not supported , it's supposed to run in the background but nothing indicates you are online . What a terrible app , now I am looking forward to the day when I will entirely stop using it .
