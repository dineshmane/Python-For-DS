Ruined Skype with new forced update
Skype Classic was a perfect , simple to use tool . Now Microsoft is forcing an update that removed key features and has now become an electron app that is unacceptable . Microsoft also ignores everyone's request to bring back the original classic and now forces people to use their terrible new version . Shame what has happened to Skype .
