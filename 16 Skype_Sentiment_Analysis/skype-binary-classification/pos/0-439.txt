Skype 8 is a clunky piece of junk
Since Microsoft took over this company they have totally screwed the product up . Skype 8 is a piece of junk , crap interface , impossible to search conversations , find files , etc . Its full of stupid animations . The app is also total junk like most MS products , their interface designers are shocking , its the most un-intuitive interface I've seen in 5 years . Absolute junk . Hope Apple make a product soon and I'd pay for it .
