Worst SKYPE version ever
Unfortunately , zero points is not possible . SKYPE has been a staple communications and meeting application for many years , until the then labelled 'classic' version was force-replaced by something unusable . No parallel chat windows , no easy way to interact with multiple contacts , and an interface that seems to be designed as a throwback to Windows 3 . 1 days . How this has been rolled out and survived usability testing is beyond me , but unless this mistake is corrected , SKYPE will no longer be viable for business or personal use for me . Simple fails such as not being able to customise a view ( e . g . " online contacts " ) to be persistent when switching to a conversation and back are so disruptive that I cannot recall any worse designed GUI for any software in many years .
