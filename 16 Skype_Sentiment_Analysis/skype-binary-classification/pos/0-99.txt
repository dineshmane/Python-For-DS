Forced Skype update is totally useless
Skype once my favorite chat program . . . no rendered to being useless ! Today I got finally forced to upgrade from my Skype Classic . I had fended off the obnoxious upgrade messages for many months , because I knew that there wouldn't be split windows for multiple conversations any more with the new skype version ( that's why I had converted back to classic many months ago ) . Skype was a good program , then MS bought it and every since then there's only crap and problems with it . Just an example : in the Android Skype App ( on my S8 Samsung ) MS has still not managed to provide me with notifications for incoming skype messages ( long lists of discussions about this on the internet as well ) . What good is a messenger for , that does not inform you of new things . Just one of many issues to wonder about , what BS are these MS developers creating ?
