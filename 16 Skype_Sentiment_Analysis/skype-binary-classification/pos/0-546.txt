Heavily Disappointed
Lets sum it all up in 5 dot points : - It messes with my Google Chrome , and it is a pain to fix . - There are major issues in transferring contacts from facebook , and even searching for solutions on the internet , I never found out the problem . - Customer service can do with a lot more work . - Freezes my laptop , even when it's the only thing running- All-In-All , Skype is a waste of time , and is a pain to use . I wanna give it half or no stars , but I can't do that . So the lowest I can go is " ONE " star .
