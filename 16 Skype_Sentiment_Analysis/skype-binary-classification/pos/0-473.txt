Updates and fixes , but without the fixes .
My Skype experience as a user has been very clunky , and ever since I used it on Windows 10 I encountered numerous problems . The most common one would be the calls randomly dropping out and video calls sometimes freezing . But the worst part about this is that it keeps pestering you with updates . I've been suckered into updating this software on a regular basis , and I always do it in hope that it may remedy the problems I had earlier , but instead nothing's been fixed . In fact I'd say the updates made it worse . Now my video camera won't even respond . It tells me to close down other programs that may be using it ( even if Skype is the only program that's cocking open ) , and the call dropouts are just as annoying as ever . There's no reason for all these updates if they can't even fix the most basic of problems . A Shambles .
