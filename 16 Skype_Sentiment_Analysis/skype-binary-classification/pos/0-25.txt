Seriously Microsoft this is so sad
Seriously Microsoft this is so sad . I usually dont write reviews but this app was bothering me know for months . First of all is the new UX design totally retarde d . I am a paying customer for Skype to Phone and took me a long time to find out how to even make a phonecall . The whole UX is very unpleasant . Then once i forgot my password . OMG what a drama to recover it . Had to solve some weird puzzles and then choose a password that i never used before . Who came up with this ? ? ? Thats the reason why people forget their passwords if you make them choose weird ones . Anyway now the design changed again and i am trying to pay for my Skype to Phone credit since its almost on 0 . But guess what ? I cannot find it . I am switching between the microsoft account and the skype account and i cannot find where to make the payment t . I only see the ret arded option to add 5 USD via auto recharge . But thats not what i want . Seriously guys , what a major fuckup . Totally lost my patience . I already thought that maybe i am just to stupid but then i check the reviews here and everybody has the same problems . Microsoft this is so sad . I was using your software since i was a child . Playing Fifa 98 on my Windows computer and so on . Everybody at my company already switched to Apple but I was like no I am used to Windows and i love it . But after today i am done with you Microsoft . Nice fucku p , seriously . . . .
