Worst piece of junk software ever
For applications that have stooped so far down to the bottom , there should be an option to give ZERO or NEGATIVE stars . Where to begin with this piece of absolute junk . Everything in it , has problems . You can't even copy text rom the chat and paste it correctly . The chat window is too small and you cannot resize it , when you have the call view open . It misscalls contact , if you are typing on one chat and a incoming call occurs , the next key that you tap , will answer the call , weher you like it or not . There's no configuration options . The only thing missing from the latest release would be an even uglier UI design and some kind of heavy adware . This would make it the perfect all time candidate on how not to do software . The notifications sounds do not work . The sound quality and general call quality , which ought to be the CORE and MOST IMPORTANT feature are the same or worse . And many others issues that I just cannot be bothered to write . What was so wrong ith the previous version Microsoft , that could not be fixed ? And , if you had to make it all from scratch , which is fine if done right , why would you choose to release such a mediocre product , long before it is even as good as the previous version ? Why ?
