Skype was brilliant
Skype was brilliant , but with each update it gets worse and worse ! ! The latest update May/June 2018 is utter rubbish , stupid layout , big text as if we are children who cant read , and sooooo sloooow ! ! Also , slower than ever at startup . I reverted back and the older version is a lot better . Time someone else did a service to replace this thing ! I would give it -1 star if I could .
