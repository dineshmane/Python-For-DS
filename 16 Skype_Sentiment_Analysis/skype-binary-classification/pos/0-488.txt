No customer support on Skype
No customer support on Skype . I can't access any email or phone support to get back into my account when I'm locked out - the on-screen and email prompts tell me I need to log in before I can access support . How unhelpful is that ! So I can't use the credit I've paid them , and can't find any way to keep using Skype , unless I create a new account , which is a hassle since I have quite a few contacts who know my Skype address . No good at all . Nil points .
