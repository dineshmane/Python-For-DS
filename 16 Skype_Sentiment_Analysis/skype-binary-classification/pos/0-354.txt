i like skype 7 a hell of a lot better then skype 8 and the only reason i unscribed from version 7 was i was having password issued and got tired of the crap but to be honestly version 8 is twice as bad and i am angered that by unstalling version 7 i lost all my contacts and that bites big time ! Very frustrated right now may try to go back and get skype 7 again as skype 8 sucks to be quite honest ! ! !
