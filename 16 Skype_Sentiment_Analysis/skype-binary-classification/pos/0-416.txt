What happened
What happened ? Suddenly calls keep dropping . I can't have multiple chat windows open . The window on my desktop takes up half the screen for no particular reason . When a call is coming in , the ringtone comes out of my desktop speakers even though the audio is set for the headset . And that's on the PC . I'm guessing that my voice calls will continue to be put on perpetual hold on the iphone every time an alarm goes off . I have been a paying customer for years . Now contemplating the annoying project of finding a replacement that gives me back seamless service delivery . Luckily I am still able to download " classic skype " - wonder how long this will last ! On the last Win10 update , it automatically replaced " classic skype " with " newCrapSkype " and I had to go find the download again at skype . com /get-skype
