In shock at efficiency of service !
We're so used to everything being a battle if you make a mistake that when common sense is taken at face value and a quick turnaround is given one is shocked ! I by mistake purchased the wrong skype call package and realised later and bought the one I needed . The lady at first asked for a small verification and quickly reversed the payment ! Amazing ! So impressed !
