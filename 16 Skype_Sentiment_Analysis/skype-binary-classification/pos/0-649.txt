Great to okay , depending what you are looking for
I use Skype mainly for intercontinental calls . Whilst there are indoubted cost benefits the quality of the " line " ( audio over IP ) is often very poor with interference and or dropping of sound . If you want to save money - great ! If you expect comparable quality to a phoneline - you might be disappointed !
