WWW - Worthless Worldwide Waste of your time ( and money )
Was great oncee but as mentioned by other reviews around the web , since bought by Microsoft went down rapidly , the amount of adds thrown into anyones bandwith is a noisance , particularly at places where you pay for data volume or with poor internet connection . I wasted my time signing up for their 'Worldwide Unlimited' calls plan trial . Thanks heavens I went for a trial or I would have wasted my money on a NON-REFUNDABLE worthless plan . I have had it running for 2 days and not a single call completed . Any number gets disconnected as soon it is dialed . Not an internet connection issue , as I can reach the same number immediately after by using another VOIP provider . Worldwide Worthless plan , stay away .
