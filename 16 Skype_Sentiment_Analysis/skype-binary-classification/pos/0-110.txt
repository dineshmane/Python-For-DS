Unfortunately I can't give zero stars
Unfortunately I can't give zero stars . Forced to upgrade today and feels like I am 15 years in the past . The new version just isn't functional . Usability is shot , layout is awful and features are missing . Uninstalling and cancelling my Skype number . Avoid at all costs .
