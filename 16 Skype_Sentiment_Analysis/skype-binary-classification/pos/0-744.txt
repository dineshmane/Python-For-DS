Save yourself money , phone abroad the cheap way .
We used to phone the USA and had a deal with BT . But our friends said get on Skype , I was talked through it and found it easy to set up . YOU DO NOT NEED A CAMERA as someone in the computer magazines insisted you did . We already had a mic and speakers . So set up was easy . I have told others about the site and the options they give you , including the option to FREE calls to the states via the internet . Most modern laptops already are set up for Skype , so there's no need to buy extra items . We saw the snow from their house as moving the laptop around you can broadcast to others . Skype gives you eyes on the world .
