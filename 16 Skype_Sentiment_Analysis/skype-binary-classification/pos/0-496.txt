Corp practices taking down a once great company
I use skype often for work/personal use and it is a great service . Also was an investor in Microsoft . Occasionally I use it to call/text mobile numbers , but not every 180 days and here lies the problem . The credit expires . Isn't that nice for your balance sheet and horrible for the customer ? I have to go through an activation hoop , if I have time/notice that my 3 . 22 cents is expiring within another 180 days . You are burdening happy customers with mindless games to save transfer balances from customers to your balance sheet . How about entrusting your product team to create features that people will happily pay for instead of features that finance/senior management want to show shareholders quick wins . Devesting in Microsoft . Wrong approach : )
