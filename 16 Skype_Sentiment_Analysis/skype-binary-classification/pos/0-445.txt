Useless now .
Useless now . I have used Skype for years with no problems for my paid calls . recently it has become a nightmare . I am unable to access my account with funds in it . I am able to input my Skype username and my password ( which takes 2 attempts with the correct password . . . the first attempt never works ) . I then get another page which says to enter my MS account . Then says . . . . . . . outlook dot ie isn't in our system . Make sure you typed your email address correctly . It usually looks like outlook . dot comMy account IS the . ie . I DO NOT have a . com account . I was asked a couple of times to do a verification thing to make sure it was , in fact , me , with a whole load ( it went on and on ) of stupid questions . Some could only be answered if I was logged in ! ! The stupidity of them ( Skype ) . Why do they need this if I have my password and my username ? Why not just a simple code to my mobile phone ? Their agents are totally inept . They took over my computer 4 times and I had to stop them One guy was where he should not have been . . . on my desktop and hovering over my folder shortcuts ! ! He actually clicked on one . . . . . . can you believe ? I have spent hours and hours with these useless guys and got nowhere . Yes . I uninstalled maybe 6 times , cleared the cache , etc etc . All to no avail . Funny thing . . . the App works fine on my Samsung . MS has made a right mess out of Skype and I am looking now for another VOIP provider . I don't need Skype anymore . Good riddence . AVOID at all costs for paid calls .
