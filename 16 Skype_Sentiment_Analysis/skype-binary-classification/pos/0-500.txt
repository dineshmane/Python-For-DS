It is impossible to actually speak to a customer reprisentative and I need help .
I put 10 euros credit on my account and I am still waiting for it to be activated . This is not good enough ! As far as I am concerned skype credit is added in emergenices becasue you need to ring abroad . I am now just waiting . Please activate the money that I added so that I can actually use your service . 4 hours Later and still no credit or response from Skype . Well done skype , you really helped me in my difficult situation . What is the point of you if not for ringing abroad in and emergency ? What else would I need credit for ? If you don't provide the service , why offer it ?
