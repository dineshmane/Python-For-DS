Even worse than the last ! ! !
Every new version of skype is worse than the previous ones . I use the desktop version . It's a design nightmare . Ugly beyond belief . Very difficult to use . Stupid symbols all over the place , like an insect infestation . Endless useless or incomprehensible options . One thing is obvious : the perpetrators of this mess just LOVE to complicate things . If they been asked to mess up skype they could not have done a better job . I used to rely on skype but now I find it unusable .
