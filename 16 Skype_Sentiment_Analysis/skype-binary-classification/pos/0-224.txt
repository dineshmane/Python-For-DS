Only Microsoft could take a product and call a downgrade an upgrade .
Only Microsoft could take a product and degrade it to such an abysmal level . Simple things , like the option to send a message using ctrl-enter instead of 'enter' have gone . Now if you want to send more than one paragraph in a message you have to remember that you cannot just hit 'enter' . Just how dim do you have to be to deprecate a very needed feature for many . The new version is inflexible with many configurable options gone . Why would anybody take away features ? You can't even have chats in separate windows or control how your online presence is managed . Awful .
