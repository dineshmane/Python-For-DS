RIP OFF ! ! lost all skype credit after being locked out of account
- When I access skype I get the message " someone else is using your account " - After multiple time-consuming attempts , I get a mail telling me to open a new account . - Apparently , all other means to contact skype ( live chat etc ) involve being logged in . - No I am without account and have lost all the money I still had in skype credits ( I paid for ! ) - I will never use skype again or even think of paying a single cent for that crappy service .
