I give the new Skype -5 stars
I give the new Skype -5 stars . Now I have lost all the contacts I had and the connection is HORRIBLE . I have been a faithful skype client for 10 years . I now use facetime because Skype is just a bad product , it freezes , delays sound , cuts out often and drops calls . Old Skype was much better .
