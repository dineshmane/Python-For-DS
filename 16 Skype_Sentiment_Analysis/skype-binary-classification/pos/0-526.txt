Skype 2015 : Dodgy practices and shocking customer service
I have once visited Korea and used my usual Skype account from there . Interestingly , according to Skype , I'm now forever based in Korea and my account is linked to some weird Korean provider making it difficult to perform the simplest transaction . Skype's customer service , unhelpful and arrogant to say the least , was trying to convince me that I set up my account with their Korean partner . It didn't matter that my account was set up years ago before they even entered into the partnership . The individual I was speaking with , didn't even bother to check these details , instead I was requested to verify my address by sending them a bank statement/ bill ( ? ! ? ! ) Once document received , the process on their end would take min 24-48 hours . Of course , she was deaf to me saying that I urgently need to purchase the service , I'm not based in Korea , I don't even speak Korean and I only holidayed there for 4 days ! She also did not care explaining why Skype members are not being warned that using Skype from selected countries can link their accounts to some dodgy Skype substitutes . This is my 2nd run in with Skype's shocking customer service in 4 weeks , both were equally ridiculous and frustrating . Skype used to be my favourite service , but it has hit rock bottom , time for a replacement .
