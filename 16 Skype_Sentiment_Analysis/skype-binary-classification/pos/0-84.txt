If I wanted to use a version of Facebook Messenger , I would , but I don't . Ever since Microsoft purchased Skype you guys have been shooting yourselves in the foot , over and over . MS bought Skype , then merged it with Microsoft Messenger , and they killed that off . That was bad enough , as I used to keep those to lists of people separate for a reason . Then came the idiotic updates that stripped features and controls away from the user . Switch off automatic updates even though what you're using is working flawlessly ? Oh hell no ! Trying to use the excuse of security ? Nope , it's not Microsoft's or Skype's job to keep MY computer safe . That's my job . I don't need a nanny . But this latest stunt of shutting down Skype , and being FORCED to update with this silly popup saying " You haven't updated in a long time " or else . Really ? I checked via certain programs and v7x and v8x both access the same servers/relays , so it can't be you're 'retiring' it because of that . So KNOCK THE CRAP OFF ! I didn't update in a long time because what I had worked fine ! So , leave off the forced updating , or revamp that tacky , obnoxious , loathsome Facebook Messenger Wanna be GUI and give us the option to have a " Classic " GUI , or there will still be thousands of formums with thousands ( if not more ) readers per forums , finding and using ways to bypass your bullying tactics .
