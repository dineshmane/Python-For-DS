The new Skype 8 for Windows is utterly terrible . What is that happened to GUI design in the industry during last years ? We can see a massive decrease of functionality for some odd kind of " flat design " fashion which is not only harder to navigate but also leaves a lot of screen space totally unused . Tons of settings and keyboard shortcuts disappeared without a trace . Quoting is horribly broken . Microsoft , please , replace your hipster " designers " with functionality-oriented developers . I am sticking with Skype 7 and looking out for an alternative IM .
