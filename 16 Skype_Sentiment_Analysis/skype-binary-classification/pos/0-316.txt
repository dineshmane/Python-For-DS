After many happy years on Skype
After many happy years on Skype , they could not verify my account into a new Microsoft system apparently . Many hours trying to fix it , countless emails , personal phone contact , more emails , all unresolved leaving me with a useless account for no reason . They still owe me account money for phone left behind . . . . never was a problem in the first place . . . So , I started a new account , it worked once with my new password , then same problem , Microsoft logo pops up and says they want to do me a favor and require another layer of identification . . . . I only got to use my account once , then fell into the abyss , no reason on earth for this . I give up on Skype , sorry to see it go . . Now to close the 2nd account . . .
