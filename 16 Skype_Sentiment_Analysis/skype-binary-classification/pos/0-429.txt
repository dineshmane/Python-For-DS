Skype has been terrible since the new updates
Skype has been terrible since the new Microsoft versions . New app look/feel is horrible on iPhone . Chats cannot be properly backed up . My contacts not logging in anymore preferring to use other chat/call services . WhatsApp , iMessage and many others are better choices for the future . The only reason Iâ€™m still using it because I have credits in my account to use up .
