Cheaper than paying .
The phrase 'At least we're not paying for this' is often used in my Skype conversations , which is definitely true . If I had to pay for a shoddy video and distorted sound I would be royally pissed off . Thankfully I don't . But the reason I use Skype , apart from it being free , is that I am travelling . I must state that one reason for my terrible phone conversations could have something to do with the hostel's wi-fi connection , but half the time such an excuse is not valid . But it does the job ( except when the call unexpectedly drops ) and hey , at least I'm not paying for it .
