Great , cheap way to communicate internationally
Me & my partner communicate using Skype all the time , either through the laptops or iPhones because we are currently living in different countries and in a long distance relationship . It is a great , free way to stay in touch and it makes it slightly easier been so far away from each other for long periods of time ! I know dont know what we would do without Skype !
