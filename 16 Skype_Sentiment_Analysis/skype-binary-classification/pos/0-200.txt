Latest Skype version ( 8 . 28 Win10 ) isâ€¦
Latest Skype version ( 8 . 28 Win10 ) is unbelievably bad . Can't believe Microsoft quality control is this bad . Why make program this important worse by each version ? Many years ago Skype was working perfectly fine . Now contact state is unreliable , status message line is not shown , chat is sometimes broken , Skype does not remember contact list settings , etc . . . Ok , If you can get video chat working , then connection is satisfactory . Bu please , make Skype better !
