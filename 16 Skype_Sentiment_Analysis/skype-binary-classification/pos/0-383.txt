FRAUDULENTLY SOLD A NUMBER THEY DIDN'T OWN .
BEWARE HAVE BEEN DEFRAUDED BY SKYPE . I purchased a Skypein number for £41 . 48 in 2016 , and have bought cards with it on , and given it to everyone I know . I renewed the subscription in 2017 and have forwarded it to my mobile and paid skype £10 for skype credit . When I tried to call my own number it goes to another company ! I rang the company and the guy explained me bought the same number from Skype 10 years ago , and ported it away from Skype 3-4 years ago as they were so useless . So , I go back to Skype to explain that they have charged me for something they did not even own , and am getting the run around by the utterly useless offshore support clowns . I have just been robbed of £92 for something I never received , they never had to sell , never worked , and now I am having to fight them to get my money back .
