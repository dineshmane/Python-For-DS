Today I was forced to upgrade from Skype V7 . 4 which was the best version to date . Version 8 is a total nightmare where they have taken away the ability to have your contacts and chat window panes as two seperate windows . Now these are combined where you can only view one or the other ! Added to this , a lot of the menus have been removed to make Skype ( as they say ) more user friendly . I personally believe this is untrue and just an excuse by Microsoft to limit what we can and can't do . Having been a Skype user for many , many years , I have now uninstalled the software and am moving to another product that actually listens to customers and understands their wants or needs . Reading a multitude of threads , Version 8 of Skype is vastly unpopular and Microsoft seem oblivious to this .
