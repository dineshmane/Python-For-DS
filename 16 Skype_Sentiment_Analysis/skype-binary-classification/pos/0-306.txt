On the rare occasion that i use Skype
On the rare occasion that i use Skype , it has been a frustrating experience . Very quick in topping up your credit but the line connection is the most terrible . You can't hear anything at the other end of the line ! You can't connect properly after trying umpteenth time and your credit is already gone ! So quick to get their money for a crap line ! Never again ! Scammers !
