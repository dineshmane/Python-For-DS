Used to be a great app that workedâ€¦
Used to be a great app that worked perfectly , until Microsoft bought it out . Since then they 'improved it' by adding over zealous noise-cancelling which will cancel out the conversation if there is any background noise . They've added more features that no-one asked for or needed making the installer pointlessly bloated . Their support is terrible , as in non-existent . You can give feedback which is completely ignored . You can email them but they never reply . The latest update ( the worst version ever ) has an unnecessarily larger single all-encompassing GUI which now won't let you have more than one chat window open , or have a chat window AND your contacts viewable without expanding huge window open . Worse , if you try to install any previous version , it will claim it 'can't connect' - of course it can connect , but it's forcing you to 'update' to the new crappy 'limited use' version . If you're looking for a reliable Vid/Voice/Chat client compact minimalist GUI , it's definitely NOT Skype ! !
