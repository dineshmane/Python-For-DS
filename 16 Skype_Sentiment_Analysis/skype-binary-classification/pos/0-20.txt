An insult to its users
Now uses an interface that insults its users with imbecilic graphics one can't disable , contact list so pointless ( it 'helpfully' heads each name with the first letter ) that one has to scroll down to see them all , a constant demand to update every time it is opened without- again , showing its contempt for its users- any opportunity to disable . . . Am now trying other substitutes that don't employ childish emojis and focuses on appearing serious and professional .
