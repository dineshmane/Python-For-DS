Skype 8 to 7 same as Windows 8 to 7 . Dysaster !
From today I wil have to look for another application to keep contacts with my suppliers as this evrsion is for boys and girls , not for people that have to work on a PC handling multiple conversation at the same time . Pls revert back to version 7 until you find a solution and some mor eintelligent programmers to make it workable . This 8 version remembers me . . . Windows 8 !
