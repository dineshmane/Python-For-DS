Accessing my Skype account is a massive â€¦
Accessing my Skype account is a massive problem . Since Microsoft has taken over Skype when I attempt to log in it requires a stack of information about the account which includes credit card details for a monthly invoice from Microsoft in connection with another product and then denies that I have " proven my identity " and excludes me from my Skpe account . Customer unfriendly doesn't begin to describe it .
