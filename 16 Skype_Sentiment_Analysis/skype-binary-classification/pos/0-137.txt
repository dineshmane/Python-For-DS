Update totally ruins Skype
Skype has been nagging me to install it's new version every time I turn on my laptop for over a year now but last night it decided to install without my permission while I was away from my computer and the result was absolute trash . Everything is slower and the interface is really ugly and so much worse , video chats are buggy and slower , the whole layout is messed up . Worst thing is I can't revert back to the old version of pre-2017 Skype so I'm stuck with this total garbage . I've been using Skype for a decade with no problems and I've really enjoyed Skype in the past , but the fact Skype forcibly installed this dumb update on my laptop without my permission AND the fact that it's universally worse than the old version of Skype is making me seek out alternatives . I've been trying out Viber and so far so good , I won't be using Skype again until they allow an option to revert back to the old version . To those of you who still have the old version of Skype , DO NOT INSTALL ANY UPDATES .
