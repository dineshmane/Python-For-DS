Micro Soft ruined Skype
In all fairness , I am not a fan of Microsoft , so my review may be somewhat slanted . True to their modus operendi , Microsoft screwed up Skype . Skyoe used to be a very intuitive application to use . Since MS took over , it is more complicated and a mess in the sense that it simply doens't work . Microsoft- get your stuff together . Then again , I don't carewhat MS does- I will no longer be using Skype .
