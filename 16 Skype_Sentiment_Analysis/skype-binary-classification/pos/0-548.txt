Old Software ROCKS - HORRIBLE TERRIBLE AWFUL Customer service
So , the new software that 'improved' the Skype experience is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE . I could not use it and had to go steal the old program off of my husband's hard drive , erase the new version and re-install since I was not able to download an old version of the software anywhere online that I saw . The old Skype interface for Mac is A+ . I love it . I wouldn't change a thing . I'm using version 2 . 0 . 8 . 866 . The customer service at Skype is 100% INEXCUSABLY AWFUL HORRIBLE TERRIBLE . I can't be any more clear than this . If you have a problem with your account or your software , pucker up and kiss your patience goodbye . You will NOT be able to locate useful information on their website . You will NOT be able to reach a customer service rep that will help you or be useful other than them doing a GREAT job of taking 18 minutes to answer one question incorrectly . I know that it's not on purpose that things are this way , but Jesus . I've been on chat for 27 minutes now and nobody can answer the question " why can't I renew my skype number for 12 months instead of only 3 " . I can't believe that it's taking this long . These people are totally incompetent .
