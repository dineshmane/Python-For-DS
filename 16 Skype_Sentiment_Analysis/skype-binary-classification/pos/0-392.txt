Skype ripped off by auto pay
Skype ripped off by auto pay . We got large $71 charge without permission . Tried to log in to cancel . Got error . We reset passwords , and new passwords was accepted , but again error message . Tried again to set passwords , accepted , again error message . We do not use Skype any more and want to cancel , but their system is not working . Their help is helpless . There is not Phone contact we can make .
