Microsoft's ignorance
Micro$oft's ignorance , arrogance and greedy incompetence continues to mark them as one of the ugliest corporations on the planet . Their destruction of Skype is one of a long list of shameful self-serving and to-hell-with-the-user acts of vandalism . Like many , I feared this day when they first got their filthy hands on Skype , as their modus operandi , that they would rape it for profit at the expense of the community , was glaringly obvious from from the outset . I avoid all their products like the plague these days and suggest others do too . Boycott Micro$oft . PS : I just tried out Google Hangouts as an alternative to Skype : it's slightly different but it works for me very well now I have got used to it .
