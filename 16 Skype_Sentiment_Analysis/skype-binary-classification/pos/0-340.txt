Wow , from bad to worse to terrible , Skypes continual durge
Skype has to be one of the only products that gets worse with 'upgrades' , terribly heavy/slow app . I just purchased international calling whilst I am overseas to call people for work and the Caller ID function does not work . I then purchased a dedicated skype number and the caller ID still doesn't work - all my calls are showing up as private . I've essentially paid $40 for the ability to listen to peoples voicemail , as not many people answer private calls . Skype also , and i guess this became a policy because of their utterly useless service , do not provide refunds for this . Oh and to top it off their support is non exsistent - they clearly have no interest in helping customers and fob pepple off to FAQ's with loops of hyperlinks , . . . . . . . . . If you are planing to use a service to call home whilst you a abroard for more than a few days I would check out VoiP providers speciailly voipstudio . I will never use skype again for calling - utterly useless . . . . I can only assume theyre actually trying to be this bad intentionally because they couldn't do it by accident .
