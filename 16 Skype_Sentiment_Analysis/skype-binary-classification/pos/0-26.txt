Skype version 8 . 41 is the worst version to dates
Just been forced to upgrade to the latest Skype version 8 . 41 . . . . what a load of rubbish . . . why cant they leave it alone , this version is worse than the previous one ( and that one was crap ) and appears to have less functionality . The most annoying thing with this new version is the lack of ability to resize the incoming video a text at the same time . It turns on my speakers when i have purposely turned them offI cant see myself when video and texting .
