Well done MS
Well done MS , if your goal was to kill Skype utterly and completely you've done it with the flying colors . Replacing Skype classic version with that atrocity of the version 8 is a pure business suicide . Those incompetent nincompoops who are making shots over there should be given the medals for being the worst in what they do . And the guys who have nurtured and developed that monstrosity should be all lined up and mercy shot in the foreheads . Can work other way around as well . Seriously , the level of pure stupidity behind that company decision is beyond the comprehension of any sane person . Next time you decide to screw us over before purchasing and taking over another of our favorite programs , please for the love of God consider donating those billion of dollars to some good cause . There are so many sick and hungry kids and since you're already wasting your money at least try to do some good in this world .
