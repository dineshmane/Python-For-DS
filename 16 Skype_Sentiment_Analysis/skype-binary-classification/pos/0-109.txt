New Skype is shocking , use another service if you can !
New Skype is absolutely shocking . Slow , full of bugs , all changes completely needless and have brought with them so many issues you have to ask yourself what are MS doing - do they not listen to feedback at all ? Was finally FORCED to upgrade after staying on Skype 7 as long as possible ( was cut off mid call and forced to upgrade ) . In the months since the new version's released Microsoft has done absolutely nothing to improve the product despite all the feedback from their loyal customers and still forces everyone to use this new garbage . Shame on you MS - if you wanted to create a new IM service aimed at kids , why didn't you do this and let the rest of us continue using an perfectly fine and serviceable product .
