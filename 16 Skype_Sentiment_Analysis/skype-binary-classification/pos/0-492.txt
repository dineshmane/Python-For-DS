Skype will take your credits !
Skype will take your credits ! If you are inactive for more than 180 days Skype/Microsoft will inactivate the credits on your account . Activating the account again is almost impossible - you have to remember amounts and dates of historic payments , which is impossible after more than 180 days . It is an unacceptable practice . Recommend to only use the free parts of skype .
