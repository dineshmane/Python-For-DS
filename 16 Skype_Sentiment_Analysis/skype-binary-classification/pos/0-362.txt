Vulnerability to Hackers is Ripe .
Great free connection to most people worldwide , however their vulnerability to hackers and viruses makes the program unusable unfortunately . The risk of having your own personal computer/mobile device being controlled through skype , by a hacker makes the user experience very much negative and has made me as a once regular user , no longer use the program .
