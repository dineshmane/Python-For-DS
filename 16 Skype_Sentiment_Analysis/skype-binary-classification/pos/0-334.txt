I dont know where to begin
I dont know where to begin . It's like they liberately design bad software . Those programmers and functional designers should be sent back to kindergarten . Of course they will think that I am 'resistant towards change' or whatever they throw in , but no Microsoft , I am totally right . Go and shame yourselves .
