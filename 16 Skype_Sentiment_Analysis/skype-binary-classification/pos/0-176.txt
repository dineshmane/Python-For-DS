Good program when it started
Good program when it started but trying to up grade the sexed-up version for mobile is an absolute disaster . they really should test the software before releasing it onto the unexpecting public ! With no option not to 'sync contacts' from my mobile , FOUR hours later it's still not completed - now I know I'm popular , but . . . ! ! ! ! ! They really have cocked this up !
