Not Good
The Things missing I noticed was no ability to change font size and when you block someone temporarily , they disappear from your friends list and there is no way to get them back . If this is where skype is going , all it's users will be finding other platforms . It felt bad enough when BIG BROTHER bought Skype . Now they want to make it worse ?
