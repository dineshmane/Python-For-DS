I am not sure why would you change something which was absolutely amazing to absolutely crap ! Skype's latest version is the worst version ever and I am saying this after having been using Skype on a daily basis since 2010 ! The only reason why they would make it worse is to push people to get the more premium paid version of it or they may be coming up with a new product and want people to jump on to that . If this is not improved soon , Skype will be history soon !
