Latest version has problems
The latest version of skype is configured in such a way that it is no longer clear where to find your Contacts list ; in fact , I have spent the last hour looking and am still unable to call skype-to-skype to any of my contacts . According to one of the support threads , I'm not the only one who has experienced this problem . I'm very disappointed by skype and hope they can solve this problem .
