Unfair Charges
Have been speaking to Skype support for weeks about unfair charges , with no result what so ever . When I call a land-line sometimes Skype starts charging even if nobody picked up , I can hear the ring tone but Skype is charging and I end up paying for connection and for the first minute even though nobody picked up . Also Skype rounds the charge into their favor . I call to a country and the charges are following : Connection fee 7 . 6p and a minute is 6 . 9 total 14 . 5p , but Skype charges 15p , they round this into their favor . I am not paying to Skype any more , will be using only their free services and for paying services will go to other provider . I would not recommend using Skype paid for services , it is a RIP OFF
