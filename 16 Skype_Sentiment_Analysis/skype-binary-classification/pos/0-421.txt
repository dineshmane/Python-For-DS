For the history that Skype has created as one of the best ( if not the best ) communication software the latest updates -I guess after Microsoft took over- the product is in huge decline . I am considering dropping it as I and my family are using it less and less everyday . This is a heads up Microsoft , take your head out of the bucket and look around . Hire some quality engineers instead of cheap ones that you think are talented , -obviously they are not- and your recruitment process should be reconsidered .
