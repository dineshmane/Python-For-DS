I have used Skype for a few years and â€¦
I have used Skype for a few years and had no major problem until recently . The latest update seems to have made a complete mess of what was a good service . It cuts outs out more than ever , its not clear anymore and the other party cannot see me on there screen . I have tried every possible setting to sort this but to no avail . As my children live a long way from me I rely on this service to keep in contact . Unless this is sorted ill not be renewing my sub with them because of the above .
