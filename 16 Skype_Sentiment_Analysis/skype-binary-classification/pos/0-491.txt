Amazing for calling on WiFi
Amazing for calling on WiFi . I always use Skype to call to my friends when we'd like to game . I've never bought a credit to call someone , guess I'll use my phone , much cheaper and better , in my eyes credits on Skype are useless . Anyway , you should definitelly use it : ) .
