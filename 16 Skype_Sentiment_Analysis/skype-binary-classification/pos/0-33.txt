I HATE the new version of Skype
If I could rate less than one star , I would . Skype used to be a simple and easy way to keep in touch with loved ones who live far away . Now , it is buggy , complicated , and in all aspects , AWFUL . I mostly used it for the fact that you can video call and share screens , and unfortunately , I canâ€™t find any other app that runs the way the old skype did . I am so aggravated with Microsoft . It is the worst application I have ever come across and I am severely disappointed in Skype .
