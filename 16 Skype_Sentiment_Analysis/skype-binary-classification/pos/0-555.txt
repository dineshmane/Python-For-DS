Skype keeps me in touch with family .
We live in a world where people are so far apart . Friends from high school and college and family members are spread all over the country . Skype gave me the ability to not only talk to them , but also see them through video chat . I have been able to see my nieces and nephews grow up even thought I'm not near them Instead of meeting every Christmas , I get to see my family every week . The same goes for my friends from school that live in other states and even other countries . Skype has let me keep in touch with the people that I love .
