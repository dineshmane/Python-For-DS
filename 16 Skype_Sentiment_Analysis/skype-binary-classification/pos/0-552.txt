Deceptive marketing , huge waste of time- avoid Skype !
I spent 20 minutes with Skype's overly complex , many-page sign in process , and even bought $10 worth of credit to begin calling , only to find out they want $30 a year just to have a number to call from . If they're going to charge that , they need to post it up front , on their very first page , not hide it after you have wasted time and money signing up for their ripoff service .
