An insult to r-tards everywhere .
What happened to Skype during recent times ? Did the sane ones die off ? It used to be good and in the last year or so it's gone completely downhill . To summarize : Cut outs in call quality . Absolute ZERO customer service . And worst of all - after an update my mic stopped working properly ( both internal and various plug-in devices ) and I tried every way to fix it - there is also no way of rolling back and using an older working version of Skype . To make matters worse . Skype web doesn't even work with Firefox browser . I can only say that Microsoft's days must be numbered if this is the way they are heading . To call this companies policies and actions of the last year r-tarded would be an insult to r-tards everywhere .
