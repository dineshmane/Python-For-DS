Too resource heavy .
After the birth of Discord , I have stopped using Skype entirely . Anything Microsoft touches turns to complete BS . Skype is laggy , and slows down your computer . Phone calls often break up , and chat messages takes long periods of time to send at times . I recommend using discord . It's fast and less resource heavy .
