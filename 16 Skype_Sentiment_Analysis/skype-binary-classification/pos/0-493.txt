I paid 240dkk for a year subscription but it does not work
Skype was kind enough to take my mone when I purchased a yearly subscription , but they forgot to give me my product . I cannot call via Skype and there is no Skype support line anywhere where I can get hold of a person who could help . Very frustrating . If Skype is reading this please contact me ASAP . 29/3 update . I have raized the score . I finally got the credit I paid for , and it now seems to work as I wanted it . However I still find it hard to get a real picture over my subscribtions and when they are valid from/to . Filip
