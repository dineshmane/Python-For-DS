Overall it's invaluable
I use Skype on my iPad and have found really useful when I'm travelling and with more and more businesses using it , it's become an accepted means of communicating in business . There have been one or two glitches for me with SMS messaging where messages have been delayed by a number of days , but no evidence of a delay at my end . But this is an isolated incident . Overall , it's invaluable .
