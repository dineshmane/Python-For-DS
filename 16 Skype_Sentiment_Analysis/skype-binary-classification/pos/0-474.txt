Good job microsoft
Good job microsoft , where do I start with these blatant morons ? Microsoft give all the companies back their shares or fund them but have NOTHING to do with the development of them you have constantly proved time and time again you are a piece of crap company i'll give you a comparison . Before microsoft stuck their crap fingers into skype . Dropped out rarelygood alternative from msnworked with long callsAfter microsoft . Constantly and randomly drops callquality of video and audio that is unstableCalls bug out of some people for no reasonmy skype stops responding randomlyfor some reason the responding problem disappears if I use the new horrible windows 10 skype ( STOP FORCING PEOPLE INTO YOUR SHI**** UPDATES ) phone skype is 100 time worse with so many options removed and a snapchat ripoff . If you value any sanity steer clear of skype and use something else until microsoft does us all the favor and leaves . Why change so much skype ? for no reason everything was perfect and then you add all these stupid features to play around with ? with no options just this is the new update if you don't update you'll suffer so update and then suffer with our ridiculous changes . . . LOOK AT GOOGLE REVIEWS ! ! ! ! on phone devices guys stuff the positive ones look how many negatives are all commenting about skypes recent update .
