Free 1-800 calls anywhere
When I am traveling around the world and need to call to airlines , credit card companies , financial companies , or businesses back in the US I use SKYPE to make those calls free . I even use them at home instead of my cell phone for those long waits for 1-800 service . Also , calls home are very cheap and easy to make from a good wifi connection with my iPad compared to using an international phone card from public phones . I don't use the video feature very much , just the audio and most calls come through better than my ATT cell phone unless the wifi is really boggy .
