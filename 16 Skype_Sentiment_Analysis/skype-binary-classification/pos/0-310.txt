You cannot polish a poo
Once upon a time , there was an application called Skype , it was simple , clever , fast and reliable . It allowed people to chat with instant messaging and IP telephony for free and even when we wanted to call a landline it wasn't too expensive . Wakey Wakey , its 2018 now . Skype has 'improved' no end , IM's take hours to send , my Android mobile rings but my PC doesn't , even if I go to answer the call on the mobile , i cannot find the button to answer the call . You have remarkably managed to turn a shining beacon of software development into nothing more than a poo , yet you continue to 'polish' it . I'd go back and get the original code that you bought and start again .
