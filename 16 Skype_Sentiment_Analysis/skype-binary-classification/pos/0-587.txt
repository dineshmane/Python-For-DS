Relied on for home and business !
There is nothing better so far for VOIP that I know of ! It's clear ( almost CD quality with the right mics ) and nearly always faultless . The webcam , group call and IM features are great also ! Not to mention it's available on nearly all smart phone platforms for free WiFi calls abroad : ) Keep up the good work guys !
