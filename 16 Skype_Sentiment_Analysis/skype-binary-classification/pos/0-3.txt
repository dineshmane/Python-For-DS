Account debacle
Logging into Skype has turned into a real debacle . The incompetent MS team has created the perfect trap for the elderly user . The trap is set by something as innocent ( and very frequent for the elderly ) as forgetting your own password . This is used by Skype as an opportunity to suggest to the user to create a MS account with which to log into Skype . After the unsuspected user agrees , the trap closes in . His entire history and friends list in his old account are rendered inaccessible . Moreover , even years later when the user tries to log into to the old account , his current account is rendered inaccessible . Skype gets into an infinite loops saying that the user account or password are incorrect . This happens even after the user changes the password of his current account through sms authentication . This entire thing us cursed . Avoid !
