Close family ? Yes but we live in Oz , USA & France !
Thank you Skype for keeping our family in touch through good times and bad . It's wonderful to see eachother and to show thinks as well as tell . My cats met their Australian furry cousins on screen ! Our first grandchild thinks we live inside the computer ! Thanks for making it all possible .
