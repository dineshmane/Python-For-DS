Expensive and service is auful !
If you need Skype for any sort of chat/voice/video that deos NOT include using a regular mobile or landline telephone connection Skype is competative - However if you need to use it in order to purchase a telephone number is any of a wide variety of countries - avoid it like a plague because the prices are truly outrageous ( $6 a month compared to $0-$1 a month by average of the sites that I examined - and if you want a refund - keep on dreaming !
