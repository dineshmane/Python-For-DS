Skype 8 is just plain horrid
Skype 8 is just plain horrid , what kind of trash is this ? - No resizable chat text windows anymore ? are you serious ? i cant type on this tiny text bar , totally unacceptable ! - No split chat windows- desktop version looks and feels like some web /mobile phone chat messenger , if i wanted to use a phone like software , then guess what we would do it . - No more multiple instances possible , i have more than one username , so why restrict it in all aspects . . - only preset font sizes ? why not allow users to choose their desired font size in numbers , no idea why skype tries to think for the user . - forced update ? i hate when companies force update their ( unfinished ) softwares , im currently deciding on an alternative , one thing for certain i will not use skype 8 that is for very sure . bring back skype classic 7 . 41 it was all good with it , it wasnt broken so do not fix it .
