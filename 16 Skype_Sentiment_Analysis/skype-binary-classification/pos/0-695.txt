A delightful way to hear from the grandchildren
When our daughter moved away to Australia with her husband we were so sad to see them both go , and even sadder to see our three grandchildren leave with them . The telephone of course is far too expensive , but SKYPE . COM gave us the perfect means of seeing our family grow up . I really can't say enough just how happy I am to have been shown this lovely lovely site .
