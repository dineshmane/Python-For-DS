From Gold to Dirt
I was kind of okay with having to downgrade once Skype 8 was rolled out , Skype 8 is utter garbage and is missing core functions and feels dumbed down in very unintuitive ways , what a waste of energy and money to make something NOBODY WANTS , you have improved nothing and nobody appreciates what you have done here Micro$oft , how do you not get it , do you even read these reviews ? Now i get a message that i cannot use skype unless i update it to the new horrible sh ! tshow , and as i dislike being shovel fed by people who think they know whats best for me even when me and many others don't agree , not allowing me choice in the matter i am going to stop using the application , Microsoft is seriously out of touch . The original dev team must be so sad .
