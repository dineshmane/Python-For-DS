I agree with so many people below
I agree with so many people below - if I could give it a 0 star rating I would ! My account has been compromised , the hacker got away with depositing money into my account . The person changed my email address to his , deleted my number and took over my account . Now I've been with customer support on chat over 3 hours ( 2 sessions ) and still no way to recover my account . Terrible service , would not recommend . Skype used to be a good service , now me including all my friends use other - more user friendly - apps .
