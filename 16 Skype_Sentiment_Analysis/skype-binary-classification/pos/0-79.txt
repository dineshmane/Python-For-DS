If I could give negative stars I would
If I could give negative stars I would . Since the upgrade to V8 on PC the presence status is useless . I have no idea when my contacts are online and available for a call and I presume them the same with me . Also Microsoft have an annoying habit on their forums of posting updates and engaging for while on reported issues ( such as this ) but then lock the thread after a few months but before implementation of fixes/changes they have indicated will be made leaving you wondering if the fix is delayed or abandoned or they just don't care anymore .
