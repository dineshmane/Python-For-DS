Don't fix something that isn't broken !
Someone really needs to cup these devs over the ear and explain the " if it isn't broken don't fix it " rule to life . These clowns have taken what used to be a very efficient means of communication and completely ruined it . Firstly they removed the ability to separate chat windows . The previous option to split worked just fine for over a decade so no idea why they got clever there . Now if you wanted the split screen you have to download the windows 10 app . . now this version no longer allows you to minimise the app to the system tray . Although it runs perpetually in the background . Honestly I have no idea why they y we used to break something that worked just fine but I guess this is how devs stay in business . From my perspective , I think I'm done with Skype . WhatsApp provide a better pc/web version than Skype and I have now migrated across to there . Would have liked to stay with Skype but I simply cannot deal with all the incompetence from their product team . Maybe I'll return one day but it certainly won't be in the near future
