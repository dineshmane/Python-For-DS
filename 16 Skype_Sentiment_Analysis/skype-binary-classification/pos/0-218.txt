There was an issue with my Skype…
There was an issue with my Skype account that prevented me from gaining access . This was not a fault on my part and after several emails and calls to try and sort out the situation , Skype were still unable to grant me access . Not only did I loose my network of contacts , many of which I will not be able to find again , but I also lost over £20 of credit to which Skype refused to reimburse tor transfer to my new account . Very poor !
