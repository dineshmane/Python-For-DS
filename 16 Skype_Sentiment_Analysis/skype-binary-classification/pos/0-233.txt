Latest update is a total fail !
I've used Skype for years , with only minor problems here and there . Overall I would have rated it 4-5 stars until the latest update . I'm simply going to uninstall it now and use WhatsApp for video chats instead . When I make a call , the big picture ( video ) on my monitor is of myself - the small video image in the upper right corner is of the person I'm talking with ( the opposite of how is used to be ) . Sometimes , the other person only sees my profile picture on their monitor ( again , on the small video image on their computer ) , despite the fact that my video icon shows it's active . Sometimes , if I double click the image on my screen , the larger video will revert to that of the person with whom I'm speaking , as it used to be . The Skype icon no longer shows up on my taskbar when I'm not actively using the program . It took me days to find out how to get my contacts to display as they used to . I've never seen such a dramatic failure of an update !
