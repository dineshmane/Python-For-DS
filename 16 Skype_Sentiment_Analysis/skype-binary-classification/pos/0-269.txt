I hate the newest update
I hate the newest update - the controls are moved around ( in some cases , hidden ) , making it harder to navigate , for no apparent reason ; and the ability to call up a contact list has been eliminated , making it much more cumbersome for me to . . . well , group-call the people on my list . Even a handy feature of call notification - that is a signal that your outgoing call is being processed has been eliminated . . . so you don't know if it's going through or not . There's no easy way to see who all you have in a group call . . . that is , who has answered and who not ( and whom you might have to call again ) . One of the " improvements " is the ability to emoji somebody with an illustration of what you feel . . . what ! ? you're on the phone ( or video ) . . . you can't just say it ? Oh . . . and the new skype can't do my special ( foreign language ) characters like the old one does . . . What's more and worse -- evidently , the old , better skype is going to be eliminated , so you don't even have the ability to stay with it .
