Time for a new rival to skype ?
Ok , I'm fed up with all the " improvements " that just make this more and more useless . Does anyone remember the first version of skype where things just worked , you could be offline or away at choosing , calls just worked , you knew when messages where delivered and it didn't take up the whole screen of a tabled to view things . Vote up if you want to join a group of people to write a rival piece of software
