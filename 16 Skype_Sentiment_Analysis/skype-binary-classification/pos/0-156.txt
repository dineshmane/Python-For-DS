Skype : rudest most incompetent customer service and help people don't want to do their job .
I'd used skype for years with little issue but I've never needed to reach customer service . Recently my credit card didn't go through for a purchase ( not the banks issue as I called my bank twice to confirm ) and then when I went to the chat help ( you can only use chat or email for support ) they took me round and round . . . . Finally I was so fed up I found a number to call Microsoft who bought skype and they took me round and round too and in addition were incredibily rude , didn't listen , talked over me and generally really unpleasant to deal with then finally told me they'd only work with me through the chat whom I explained were not able to help me and I wasn't dealing with anymore after several days of getting no where using chat support . Totally stupid/time wasting situation . . Honestly , all they needed to do was cancel my transaction and/or take my card manually ( which I am not able to do on my end ) . They didn't need to be rude and difficult to work with . Have lost me as a customer . I'll take my business elsewhere and I suggest you do the same .
