Not what is used to be . . .
Skype used to be the communicator of choice , then Microshaft got their hands on it and pretty much ruined it . - Can't block spam caller numbers . - Telephone numbers in chat list- incoming calls not recorded in the call logProper shambles . WhatsApp is now my default .
