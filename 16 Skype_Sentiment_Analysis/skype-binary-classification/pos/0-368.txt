King Midas in reverse
Never used it much , so it came as a surprise that it was such crap when I did several months after the " upgrade " . . . Wait , I'm not really surprised , in fact . Microsoft has made some good stuff in the past , not great , but good . However , with garbage such as Windows 8 - 10 , it's no surprise that Microsoft can be like King Midas but in reverse . Everything they touch turns to crap .
