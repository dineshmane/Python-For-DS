One of Microsoft's many big mistakes
One of Microsoft's many big mistakes . Yet again trying to catch up with a trend they did not initiate ( in this case , youthful social networking ) and by doing so , alienating their serious user base ( people who just want to call someone on video or phone , not throw emojis or add silly drawings to pics ) . Incidentally , horrible design and graphics .
