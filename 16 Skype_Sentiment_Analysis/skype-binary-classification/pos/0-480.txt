Since Microsoft bought Skypê they have SCREWED it . Customer service is now no longer " normal " people somewhere in the Baltic states . No , its some indian numpty in a clearing in the jungle who doesnt know jack sh+it . You cant phone , you cant email - only option is chat with the numpty in the jungle who is working from a check list . IT IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER EVER EVER EXPERIENCED . It SUCKS ! ! ! !
