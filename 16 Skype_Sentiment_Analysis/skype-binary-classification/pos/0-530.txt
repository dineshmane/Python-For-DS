Skype credit waste of money
I sent a number of Skype sms text to my girlfriend's mobile and she received none of the messages , although I have £10 of credit . After making the messages I was charged for them ( the Skype credit has deductions made for the messages ) and it says that they were delivered but she did not receive them . When I use my regular Tesco mobile to contact her she receives the message . I think Skype free services are excellent but their sms to a foreign mobile ( UK to Austria ) are a waste of money . I only lost £10 . I suppose they collect revenue for their free services this way : - ) Last £10 you'll get from me .
