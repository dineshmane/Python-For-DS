Removing Subscriptions : A web of confusion and deception
I have been a skype user since there were just 30 , 000 users on the system . A long time . I have enjoyed many good years and hundreds of hours with friends and relatives all over the world . On the strength of this I created a Business account , added my credit card details , added work colleagues , never really benefitted from group screen sharing because it never worked and it turned out to be an expensive console to add or remove members . I have tried to cancel the subscription on my credit card , but it has not been possible because it tells me I should transfer credits to a user before I can do this . There is no way to do this because the web page for months has given me a system error . Today I received another subscription payment notification with my credit card statement . . . just to add further insult to injury ! It's not even possible to delete an account . What's that all about ? Even Facebook deletes photos now ! Skype customer services hides behind pages of inter-linked information that goes around in circles of Q&A pages and when I have been able to find a mail address to write to I don't get an answer . Very disappointing . Now I use Viber .
