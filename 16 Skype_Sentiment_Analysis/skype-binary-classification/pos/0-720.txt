Good most of the time
Skype , although I don use it much , is a great tool to maintain communication with distant people , business , friendship or pleasure . But in order to maintain that communication in desirable level , they need to improve it , because the laggines ruins it on video calls , even if you have great cam and internet speed . Other than that it does what it says most of the time .
