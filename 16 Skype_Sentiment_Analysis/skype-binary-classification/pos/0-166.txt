Skype has changed for the worse overâ€¦
Skype has changed for the worse over the years . I had a bunch of marked contact numbers in the old version of skype , which vanished with the new version , why oh why couldn't it carry those contacts over ? Sometimes when I am on a call with someone , there is no history of the call being made after I close the call . I could see their number whilst on the call , and then it just disappeared . The new version is terrible . Please bring back old skype and just leave it alone .
