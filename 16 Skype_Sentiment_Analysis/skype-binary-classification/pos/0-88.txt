New Skype reflects on Who and Whatâ€¦
New Skype is Who Microsoft is today . . . they hire programmers from all over the world and turn the company over to them . Everybody knows Programmers no nothing about what Users want . . . . There is No chance any serious Customer/Consumer input was sought or used in making these changes and this is what you get from people who don't even use the Software they produce . Smart companies would allow you to keep the old version , but Microsoft only listens to Voices that want new ones . . . No doubt any New they get will be a Net Loss . Big
