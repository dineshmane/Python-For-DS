suddendly stopped , no advise , no refund on 36€ ! . . . what a fck !
Since more than 10 years , I was a convinced skype customer , using them daily and paying them monthly ! Yesterday , suddenly my external skype dualphone RTX 4088 stopped working . No calls , no agenda , no nothing . Then I found out that Skype stopped supporting this kind of phones ! What ? Why didn't they advise ? ? Today I had a live chat with them and they just said : our refund policy does not allow us to refund you the 36€ or credit . Bye bye . **** Sorry , but this is absolutely inacceptable ! ! ! ! Microsoft everyday is worse ! I will not spend my future money on this company !
