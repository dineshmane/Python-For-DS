Skype was a great service until the recent updates , which are just hideous . Can't sign in from facebook anymore , don't have a microsoft account , built a new email to sign in because apparently my . edu email address won't work . And then it required cell phone confirmation , and I don't have a cell phone , which is why I use Skype in the first place . Didn't see any warning about the new login system , now have Skype credit trapped in an account I can't access , which is just awful . After making several hours a week of Skype calls for almost eleven years , I'm finding a new platform .
