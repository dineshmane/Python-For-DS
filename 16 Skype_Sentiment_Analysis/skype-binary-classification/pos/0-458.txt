Kept calling same number
Opened up window to call a number and typed the number in and dialled it and call went ok . Then deleted number in the box to call a new number . Skype called the old number again . Found out that this is some crazy feature Skype added which is not user friendly and annoying . Instead they tell you to 'close the call window and open it again for every call you want to make' . Sorry Skype you just lost a customer out of embarrassment due to calling someone over and over when another number was displayed . Do your developers actually test their product on simple casual users or are they out to make the skype experience as frustrating as possible nowadays ?
