I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is , but every release of Skype over the last year has made the software worse . In the latest iteration , MS decided to give messages an orange background , severely lessening the readability because of reduced contrast . Only slightly less painful are the smilies that show up with EVERY message . You're in a serious or difficult conversation and the inappropriate smilie is there every message . And those are just the most excruciating issues . Get a grip MS .
