No longer a useful tool
Used to be a light , functional and useful little assistant for work and family - MS has ignored its seasoned user base requests for a version of Classic to be available to those who want it and proceed to force features , privacy invasions and updates . I will be putting in as much energy in encouraging my contacts to switch to any other app as i once put into promoting Skype until and unless MS provides a reasonable version . . if you want to know what that entails then look at V7 and previous .
