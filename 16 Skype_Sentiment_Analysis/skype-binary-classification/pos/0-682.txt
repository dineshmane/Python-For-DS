Fantastic
On an extended trip abroad and having elderly relatives ( none computer owners ) I need to keep in touch with I checked out various ways of making cheap telephone calls . I have found Skype by far the most convenient , easiest and cheapest way of doing this . So easy to add more credit and very low prices .
