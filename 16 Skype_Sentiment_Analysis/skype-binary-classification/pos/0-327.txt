Relaunch ?
Classic change for change sake and for the worse ; presumably a new generation of developers or new management feel the need to make their personal mark on this product , but it seems rather odd that MS are allowing them to turn off so many customers . Alternatively Microsoft want to trash the old name so the whole service can be re-launched and re-branded as an exciting and innovative MS product . I can visualise the marketing people in presentation ecstasy as they choose the new name for something that actually functioned very well when many of them were still at school .
