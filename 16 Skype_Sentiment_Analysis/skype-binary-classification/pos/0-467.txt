Why oh why does some idiot somewhere â€¦
Why oh why does some idiot somewhere want to keep messing around with apps and update them for an unsuspecting and I would guess mainly unwanting user base . Microsoft , I am not 15 and I don't want my Skype app to be something a 15-year-old would love to use ! Why does your iOS version default to speaker ! ? Why is it so difficult to navigate ? Why does it make the most ridiculous sounds ? Go back to how it was .
