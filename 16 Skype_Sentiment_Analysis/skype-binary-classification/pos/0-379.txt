this is sooo bad that I have no words for it - there is no way to transfer your contacts from one account to another or from your contact list - I have taken the NEW Skype out of my computer ! ! The old one still works ok , but DO NOT download the new version - it is BAD ! It garbles your contacts and puts in names that you have no idea who they are and then you cannot delete them - BAD ! ! 0 is my rating
