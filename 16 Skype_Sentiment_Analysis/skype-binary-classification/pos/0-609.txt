Expired credits are always unacceptable
I like Skype - and it works well enough . However , the idea that my credits expired over time ( a few years ago ) is something I cannot tolerate . We give money to them in advance - which means they have our money for a time without having to provide a service , then they tell us that we have to use them within a certain time period of they will confiscate the credits . This is very poorly thought out approach since it alienates the customer for good . It is like insult added to injury . If this policy were not in place , I would still be a spending customer with Skype . The net profit for Skype with me would have been in the positive . I'm afraid that this is a poor decision made by management that will cost Skype in the end .
