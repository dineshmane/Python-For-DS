Skype 8 , the version that killed Skype for me .
I have used Skype since 2004~2005 and never had a need for an alternative but , then Microsoft stepped in . Ever since then the quality and usability just kept going down hill , never ending troubleshooting . The few better features of Skype aren't worth the trouble , plenty of alternatives . I have been considering alternatives for a while and Skype 8 finally gave me the reason to move to something else . The forced update refused to work for me , couldn't get past the log in screen , was stuck on never ending load screen . With all the troubleshooting i had to do with Skype in the past year i just didn't bother anymore . " Good job " MS team responsible for Skype . They took something that was working fine and destroyed it . With Skype classic dead , Skype is dead . From the comments it seems its not just me , but quite a few average Skype users .
