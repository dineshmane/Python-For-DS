Absolute rubbish App for iphone
Absolute rubbish App for iphone . Call quality is terrible and constantly drops . Promises to be a phone service i . e . you dial a local number but really it is using 4G / wifi data to a server in your country which then makes a Voip call overseas to a local / mobile number . Voxofon and Rebtel are far superior platforms with high call quality . Do not waste your money . Microsoft should be ashamed of this !
