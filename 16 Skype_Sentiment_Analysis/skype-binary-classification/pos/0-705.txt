Great Company ! I recommended them to my Son . I bought an ionizer from life ionizers about 3 years ago . I liked the fact that they customized my filtration system and the water has done wonders for my health . At 62 years of age I appreciate things that optimize my health and well being . I called up to get new filters and they told me how to maintain my machine , which was great . The good deal was that 3 years after I bought my machine they sent me a free one year membership in their alkaline lifestyle health community . Great information on having a healthier lifestyle !
