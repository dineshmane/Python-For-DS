I have always hated Microsoft and now I hate them even more
WORST UPDATE EVER . . . . . . . . I have used Skype for over 15 years for business communication and overseas voip telephony , but since Microsoft took over they have absolutely killed everything . Why on earth anyone would think it was a good idea to remove all the existing critical functionality and replace it with childish gimmicks like a colourful interface is beyond me . I can't even access the contact list on my mobile phone anymore . Instead have to search for the contact , then copy and paste the phone number over to Skype application to make a call . It's a fricken voip telephone service . . . what possessed you to unlink the contact list ? ? Seriously ? ? No words ! ! I never take the time to write reviews , but I guess I'm really hoping someone at Microsoft is listening . To put it as nicely as possible , you've basically taken a perfectly good , feature rich product and turned it into a colourful featureless piece of rubbish ( I wanted to use a much harsher four letter word ) . Good work ! ! !
