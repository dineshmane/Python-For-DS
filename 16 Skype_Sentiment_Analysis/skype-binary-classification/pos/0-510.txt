Skype is a scam
My old Skype account was compromised and money taken from my account . Skype " customer support " ask you to fill out a verification form . I filled out this form 3 times and they said each time that I did not fill it out correctly so they can't discuss this any further . I copied the information directly from the logged in account , so I can only believe that this is deliberate so that they don't have to support you . Not supporting you means that they can keep your money . The timing of the hack is especially suspicious as it happened straight after I reactivated some old credit on the account . I firmly believe that the attitude among their support staff is to deny support . The biggest worry though is that since they are owned by Microsoft now , any credit cards you have on file with Microsoft Live for other services are SHARED with Skype . So they will continue to defraud . I've given them plenty of opportunity to resolve this , even tweeting them . They even said their supervisor would contact me but nothing . They have no interest because their whole support system is corrupt .
