DISASTER : After using Skype since Day 1
After using Skype since Day 1 , I will be forced to leave the service - after having been a paying subscription business user . At least on my laptop version [the latest] , there is no " menu bar " and no sign whatsoever of basic features like setting voicemail , checking connection speed - much less proactive blocking of users nor being able to sue the dialpad during calls - essential for long distance teleprompts . Instead , this is essentially a TOY and the customer " support " is simply classic Microsoft arrogance .
