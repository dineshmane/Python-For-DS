Watch your credit balance carefully for hidden deductions and products that you have not chosen .
We received this message in our email . We did not know about this credit deduction from our Skype account until we received the following email . We've delivered your orderYour Skype Number is now ready for you to use . In some cases you may have to wait up to an hour for your Skype Number to be activated . If you have any problems , visit our support section on skype . com . Next stepsIt took us over 24 hours to contact customer service . The phone number to the Netherlands is wrong . Finally , I received a link to live chat . ( 15th November 2015 ) The customer service rep blamed me for everything . He used poor English and it was difficult to understand him . I was emphatic that I did not order this product . I suggested that it was a scam . He suggested that I change my password which I already did when I received the first email . Obviously , I would know if I ordered the product . I do not want this product so why would I order it ? I found this suggestion unacceptable , belittling and rude . I am very disappointed with Skype . This is a warning to other customers . Watch your credit balance carefully for hidden deductions and products that you have not chosen .
