terrible new update
Imagine being told you're getting a brand new car that's gonna be better than your last , yet all you actually get is a bike without any pedals that's missing a wheel and has no handlebars . that's what this new update is for skype . how can anybody in their right minds remove more features than they add and have the audacity to say " yeah , this is an update " in my experience , here's everything i've noticed wrong with this new skype : -way slower , whether you have a high end computer or just a laptop , your messages are gonna take 3 seconds to send before they show up in chat , you're not gonna see new messages pop up until they load for about 5 seconds , the entire interface is slow , clicking on things is laggy , it's just slow -an unacceptable amount of cut content . They removed so many options , and added maybe 3 new useless things . i can no longer choose the font i wanna use , no longer adjust my notification settings , no longer send 3 min . video messages , no longer change my audio settings , no longer turn off emoji'sbut oh , it's okay , you can change skype to be black nowy'know , just as a reminder that there's now a much better application you could be using , discordso many things are just bad .
