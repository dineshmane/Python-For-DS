It works well once you're set up , but setup is a challenge .
This is an edit from an abysmal review I wrote earlier . There are four things I don't like : 1 ) I am very confused about logging on with username or password . If I log on with username , it seems to be an entirely different account , and nothing works . 2 ) It is very difficult to find the links for live help . FAQs don't help much . On the other hand , once you're in a chat with tech help , things go pretty smoothly . 3 ) When you pay for a service , Skype automatically makes it a recurring charge . This is nakedly profit seeking , and should not happen . I'm quite capable of deciding if I want to continue the service or not , thank you . 4 ) The add credit thing is confusing . I wasn't seeing my subscription show up ( see issue #1 ) , so I added credit . I hope I can apply that to my subscription rate over the next couple months . Unfortunately , there are a lot of horror stories online about that , so I guess we'll see .
