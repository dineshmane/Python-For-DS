Worst ever customer support
Received an email from Skype saying I'd changed my password - I hadn't . Tried to contact them to say I hadn't but this was impossible as I'd changed my password ! ! Others have mentioned wretched for which is actually impossible to complete as can't prove identity as password doesn't work . . . . Next thing get 2 debits of Â£100 on my credit to a Skype account that's not mine . Impossible to contact Skype for reasons above and have to go though the rigmarole of cancelling credit card . Opened another Skype account but would never put money on ( gave up trying to get balance on my hacked account ) and would advise all against giving them cc details . Great product but dangerous . . . .
