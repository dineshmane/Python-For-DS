Speechless !
If only I could give a minus star ! This has to be the worst ever " up-grade " ever . Who came up with the brainwave to take away all the useful functionality and instead add childish gimmicks . I'm sure Microsoft had their top team working on this up-grade ! Lets stop , take a breath , be brave and go back to the old version . . . . " if it ain't broke , don't fix it " . . . . Words fail me .
