Skype used to be fine why did Microsoft broke it
I use Skype for work for more than 10 years . This new interface is impossible to use for me . i can't have a window per conversation anymore plus closing it kill the application instead of just minimizing as it used to . I can't afford security risk linked with downgrading to previous version so I'm actively looking for another solution .
