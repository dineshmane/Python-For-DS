Refusal to issue credit refund
I just found out that skype will only refund credits bought within 14 days of purchase . Is this legal ? In California gift cards purchased ( basically advance credit ) can't legally expire , so how does skype get away with keeping money you paid them for credit which hasn't been used ? Regarding another issue , in attempting to reach a skype representative through their online chat feature , I waited for over 50 minutes as I was informed there was heavy volume , but I was still in line to reach an agent . When an agent finally came online , I was told they could not help me because a system update was in progress . Anybody who knows anything about computer systems realizes they could have generated a message explaining that the system update was in progress and for customers to try again later , but , instead , their failure to implement a simple solution kept dozens of customers waiting , collectively , for hours . What's worse is that in chatting with a supervisor the next day , he didn't know enough to realize this and dismissed my suggestion , saying I didn't understand their system . Terrible customer service !
