The software needs a bit of work - a bit intrusive
The service is great - super useful . However , the software needs a lot of work . The settings are difficult to use and are not organised logically . The default sounds Skype ships with are horrible . Screen sharing now costs money ? I understand that they need to make money - but I feel like I may need to look for a new alternative .
