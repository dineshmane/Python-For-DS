The new Skype stinks
Skype used to be a simple , effective , user-friendly app . EVERYTHING about the new Skype is bad . All the useful features have been removed . The new version is klutzy - e . g . several clicks to delete chats one by one ! ? ? Very difficult to do anything . Nothing is intuitive . What happened to the useful symbol 'away' ? Now I can only put 'invisible' . I used 'away' when I wanted to talk to just one person . When I call skype to skype , there is an annoying beating heart symbol at the bottom of the video screen . Very irritating . When I was forced to upgrade ( downgrade , actually ) , names of old contacts I had removed years ago appeared in my contacts list . I can find no way to remove them - only block them . My contacts list gets cluttered with a list of conversations I've made , and I can only remove those one by one . I could go on indefinitely about the bad features . What kind of morons designed this new version ? ! I will be migrating from skype as soon as I find an intelligent replacement .
