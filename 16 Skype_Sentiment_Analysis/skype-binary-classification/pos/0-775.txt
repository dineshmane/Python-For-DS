Best way to stay in touch
Since moving overseas , Skype has been the key to staying in touch with family and friends stateside . I love that I can use it as a substitute for text messaging ( huge savings there ! ) , on my phone like it's a normal phone call , or on the computer to see everyone " in person . " Such a lifesaver !
