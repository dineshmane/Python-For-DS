A nightmare to cancel my charges for using Skype
I used " Skype " to talk to a friend in America a few months ago . And although it was so very easy to set up payments from my Bank account to use " Skype " , it was a different story when I wanted to end my contract . It took so many phone calls And emails to " Skype " to cancel my payments . I must have wore out the buttons on my phone . I spoke to so many different operators on the phone . ( It nearly drove me " Mad " & I shed a few tears with frustration . ) They couldn't find my user name or my account number , & all sorts of problems . Eventually I found a rep of there's who helped me , & I was just so relieved to be free from them . NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE SKYPE
