Great Product Killed by Microsoft
I have been using skype for several years in work capacity . It was a fabulous product until MS took over . Since then it has been on a downhill due to Microsoft trying to monopolise it and add unnecessary features to it to make profits out of the software . Very poor stability , awful user experience , application unstable most of the time , Inability to answer calls , multiple interfaces kicking up on incoming calls , issues when multiple sound devices connected and the list goes on . Shameful for a company like MS who has huge brain , technology and financial resources .
