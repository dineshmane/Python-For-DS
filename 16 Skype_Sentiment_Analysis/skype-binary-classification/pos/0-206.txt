Skype used to be tele-contactable
Skype used to be tele-contactable , helpful and easy to use . I think Microsoft is trying to kill it by making it as user-unfriendly and remote as possible . As a multiple stroke victim ( 7 in 18 months ) with limited manual dexterity , typing on live chat is exhausting and difficult ( made more so than necessary by the tiny window a customer has in which to explain his/her problem . The message is clear : " GO AWAY , we're not really interested in your problems with our now-restricted service ! "
