I bought a new number from SKYPE but it failed to warn me that this new number could not be forwarded to a different number than my existing number is designated to forward to . There is no way of fixing this or getting my money back for the number I just bought so I feel ripped off completely as I had to open a new account then buy another number for exactly the same price as the one that is of no use to me . There is no call centre to ask someone whether they could be reasonable about this so I feel angry and frustrated by this multi-billion dollar company ripping me off .
