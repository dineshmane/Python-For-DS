Terrible
I tried the new version of Skype several months ago , hated it and went back to the Classic version . Now I'm being forced to use the new version ( from 1 September , but I've " upgraded " now ) . I still think it's terrible , but at least I've managed to regain camera control thanks to Manycam . com
