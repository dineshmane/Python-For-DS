Skype was reliable back when I purchased a phone number , 13 years ago . Now the software is so slow that when I try to answer the phone , the caller gives up and hangs up before the software responds . Also , there is no way for the notification number to go away , when there is a new message . Once you get a message , the number stays with the Skype taskbar icon until you shut the software down , no matter how many times you open the chat with the new message . Because of the software issues , I'd have dumped this service years ago , but the phone number I purchased is the contact number we gave a lot of companies and vendors .
