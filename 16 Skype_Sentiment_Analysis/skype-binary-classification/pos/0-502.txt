When enough is enough
When will Microsoft estimate that they earned enough money and that they can start doing thing for the users and not for them to earn more money ? Microsoft bought Skype ( by the way I hate the guys that sold that company to Microsoft . you had a pearl and gave it to the devil , shame on you ) . and since then my Skype is just annoying me more and more day after day . The problem is that I was one of the first users of this program around me nobody used it that I was telling every one about it . . now I just feel a shame to have participated to the extension of this program . So Skype since Microsoft : - obligatory update . -big load on my computer but also modem usage . - discontinuity of compatibility with the skype mobile I bought for a lot of money . - discontinuity of service to the fixe phone I also bought a lot and for all family . - discontinuity of service with Samsung new TV I bought just for that . . . - and now the latest , Skype make commercial with sound so suddenly out of the blue in the background of my computer a voice comes and scare the s . . . t out of me . I thought my grand ma was crazy when she told me that she heard sound coming from her computer . . . but then I understood . and till now I have found no way to deactivate that except just closing sounds completely for Skype . . . I am sure that you have a longer list and have other issues with skype since Microsoft took it over . for example cut of services all day or weeks in certain country ( never seen before Microsoft took over ) . . . Anyway , Bill don't you think you have enough money ? is it not time to give back to the users without trying to F . . k us with backdoors and I don't know what .
