Dear God MS
Dear God MS . What are you doing ? ? ? Skype was a wonderful product until the last few years . The " upgrades " and ESPECIALLY the UI now is terrible . TERRIBLE . Why the hell don't you TEST with your loyal users BEFORE you send the product out ? My whole company has used Skype for years and we almost live on the thing . But now . . . . we are all uniformly scrambling to find another system . You simply MUST let pro users be able to customize the UI . All the things people complain aout the new UI below are real and true . WHY WHY WHY do I have to be SUPER-CAREFUL now that I don't hit " Enter " or the message simply flies out to the recipient . CTRL-Enter should still be available . There are DOZENS more examples . Even the SOUNDS now are super-annoying . Please get back the Ver 7 functionality . Revert to the code that worked , PLEASE . I've used this product since the very beginning and it's a crying shame what you are doing to what was a perfectly wonderful program . I *will* change ( and so will my entire company ) if this does not get sorted . So , so so sad . Sigh .
