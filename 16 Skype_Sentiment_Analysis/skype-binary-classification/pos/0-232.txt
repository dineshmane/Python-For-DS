It used to be good like over 10 years ago . . . Now it's just a spam attachment to hotmail . What I think is really bad though is how if you don't reply to a message now . . it says you still have that message . Once you look at a message it should mark it as read . My only guess is they have put on some REALLY bad designers and programmers . Microsoft needs to remove the Skype add-on from hotmail too as it is 100% unwanted .
