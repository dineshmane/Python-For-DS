My hubby is in the army , and we couldn't live with out SKYPE when he was deployed ! ! !
Skype would have got 5 stars , but the video likes to freeze up and calls get dropped , but what can u do when it's free and ur talking to people in different counties . I <3 skype and can't thank them enough it made his 12 month deployment easier on both of us . We skyped everyday several times per day ! ! ! ! ! THX SKYPE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
