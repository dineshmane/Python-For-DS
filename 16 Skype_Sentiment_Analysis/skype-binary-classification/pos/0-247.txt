10+ years of using skype just ended .
After more than 10 years of using Skype as the go-to communications platform I'm now forced to update to the dreaded " new " update since older versions will stop working . It has terrible design that lacks some of the most basic functions . Good job destroying one of the biggest and best communication platforms for no reason and making long-lasting users switch to alternatives .
