Skippy is dead
Skippy is dead . RIP Skippy . When I try and sign in only my email of 10 years ago comes up . Poor Skippy . I have tried about 10 times now to reset password and email . New email works . Skippy barked . But the password does not . Skippy Farted . So this is called a circle of hell . There are no more humans at microsoft so I am not prepared to spend another hour on useless forums . Bye bye Skippy . You are dust
