This update is utter garbage
I've used Skype for the past ~8 years and this new update is just god awful . Old skype used to show the names and statuses of people in group chats . Now it says that there are X participants , and I have to click on it to see who's even in the group , and even in that window , it doesn't show any status update for anyone who isn't online . I want to see that people are offline/away/busy , don't lump them all into a non-existant indicator . When group video chatting , it forces you to either pick one person to focus on , or have everyone 'optimized' to fit the window . If they aren't centered to their camera you just can't see them . Why cant I have the option to see EVERYONE's FULL CAMERA , even if it would be smaller . Why can't I adjust the size of the chat box when I'm in a call ? So many useful features from the old skype have been stripped away leaving this un-customizable , frustrating-to-use shell of an app . It's like skype felt threatened by Discord's increasing popularity , tried to rush out an update and completely dropped the ball .
