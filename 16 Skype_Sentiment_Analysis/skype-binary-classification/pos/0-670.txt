I get to see my new grandbaby up close without having to leave home !
My daughter lives in another state and I am unable to fly there to see my first ( and probably ) only grand child in real life . Skype is amazing ! The picture is SO clear and usually the voice is as if we are right beside each other as we visit . I can see the baby stretch and smile and sleep while my daughter and I talk to each other . Life is GREAT ! Skype is GREAT !
