disrespectful update
we have been using skype to conduct business across 46 countries for the last 12 years , it was a very important tool for our company . The new version is a childish tool that removes the simplicity of use and ergonomics of the tool . It reflects such a lack of respect for clients that we are looking at alternatives , even those we'll have to pay for . I will gladly pay not to use such crapware .
