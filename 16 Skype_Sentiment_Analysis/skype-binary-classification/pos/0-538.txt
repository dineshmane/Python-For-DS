Inability to secure you account against fraud , horrible customer service .
In the past three months I have lost just under $100 from spammers on Skype . My account was used as a spammer's delivery tool in Sweden . Over one-thousand SMS texts were sent from my account - half in September and half early November . In September , a hacker gained access to my account and began to spam people in Sweden with texts . I promptly went to Skype customer service - attempted to resolve the issue , be refunded and move on . We took all the necessary steps to recover my account and make sure that nobody gained access to it again . Customer service agreed to refund me for the " Auto-recharge " cycles that occurred 5 times during the hacker's shenanigans and cost me $14 each time . Since then I have cancelled auto-recharge . However , I have still not been refunded . If that isn't enough - in the past few days THE EXACT SAME THING has happened to me . I followed the same steps , talked to Skype customer service . . did all of the security measures to ensure that it didn't happen again . I explained to them that even though my " auto-recharge " was turned off - it WAS STILL HAPPENING . They promptly continued on with the same security measures that did not protect me the first time . . . or the second time . Upon me asking for a refund due to their inability to secure my account , the customer service rep then told me that it's not their responsibility . Allow me to make that clear to anyone willing to give Skype their personal information and/or money - IT IS NOT SKYPES' RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP YOUR ACCOUNT SECURED . After spending 1 . 5hrs on the live chat with a customer service rep dodging my requests for a refund , he told me that they needed to " convert this communication to email so we could further investigate the said issue " . On my approval of this " conversion " the chat was ended by the rep . Full transcript available on request .
