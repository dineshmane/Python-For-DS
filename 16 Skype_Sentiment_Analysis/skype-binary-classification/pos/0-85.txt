BAD ? it's terrible , horrible , shocking , outrageous , atrocious , flagrant !
I'm using skype since 2008 , and i quit skype 1 months ago starting using telegram ! why ? i will summary the features of " microsoft skype " as below : 1- crash all your chat history2- slow chat experience , losing connectivity every 2 minutes . 3- laggy software just like internet explorer . Thanks microsoft for spoiling one of best software's ever .
