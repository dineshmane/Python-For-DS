Skype is the WORST product you hate to LOVE . If it weren't for the constant forced updates , the shifting of the buttons and everything else , it would be horrible . I receive at least 10 spam calls every single day ! It's the best part about it really . Then one time , I tried to delete my skype phone number . That was great . I couldn't , and even more , I can't even keep people from calling me ! Talk about customer satisfaction . Imagine . This is the most technical company on the planet ( Microsoft ) and we can't delete a number immediately . And people think we went to the moon ! ! HAHAHAHA .
