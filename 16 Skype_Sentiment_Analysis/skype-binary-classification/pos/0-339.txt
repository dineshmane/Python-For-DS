No chance to use Classic Skype for Win10
Classic Skype stopped working on May for multiple Win10 users including me and I was obliged to use Skype 8 . In 2 words - this version is unacceptable for work . I have 50+ chats every day and new Search doesn't allow me to find needed chat . some chats cannot be searched at all ( those with " Name1 , Name2 " ) . Searching public directory when I just want to switch local chat is completely redundant . Dozens of missing features like Copying/quoting several messages , creating chats by multi-selecting participants of existing chat , no search inside chat , lags and crashes when searching messages history , no Ctrl+Enter sending , no hyperlinks in chat names , . . . I can continue this list endlessly . Make Classic Skype work for Win 10 at least !
