Latest update of skype in July 2018 is a total disaster . It was forced on my computer by the . . . . . at Microsoft and has replaced a reasonable version of skype with garbage . It is not even worth 1 star . Some idiot has decided that making most of the text grey is a great idea . It's not as I can't see it clearly . Try to get your heads around this you MS morons ; " if we can't see it properly , it really is not much good to us " . The idiots have also been making up " themes " as if this any use at all . You can have faded blue , burnt yellow or something else I truly do not want . Worst of all , the downgraded the software so the webcam is now a fuzzy mess , out of focus and pretty much less , yet for other applications my webcam is clear as a bell . Thanks so much MS for destroying skype . Before you got your filthy hands on it Skype was brilliant . No danger of that any longer . Meantime , I will look around for something else and I advise everyone to now do the same . Microsoft of course will ignore all criticism because they feel they don't need to take any notice of people who use their stuff . Well things are changing fast MS . Your market share is down to less than 8% and the time is coming when you will be replaced by something better . Perhaps then and only then will skype be given a new lease of life when it removed from MS .
