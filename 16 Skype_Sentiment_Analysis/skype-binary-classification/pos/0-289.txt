New Skype suck
New Skype suck . First of all it is laggy , which classic skype was never . I cannot find keywords in conversations anymore using ctrl+f , which used to be a very useful feature . When you open pictures from skype the open over the whole screen so that you cannot see the conversation anymore . If you happen to close the window by mouse you also close skype . The design is also less appealing , not as easy seeing who is online etc . I cannot see one single betterment with this update . Very , very dissapointing .
