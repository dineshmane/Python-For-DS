A blatent downgrade .
Absolutely awful . No longer going to be using Skype , even though I have been using it for years . I thought my friend was exaggerating when he told me how many customization options they'd gotten rid of . I'm particularly annoyed at the notification settings , where you either have " everything on " or " everything off " . I can't work with message previews popping up in the bin and sounds constantly binging , but I don't see the tiny little number fade into existence at the very bottom of the Skype icon on my computer . The lack of messaging settings , audio settings , video settings , file download settings - it's frustrating being forced into a clear downgrade . I'm using a desktop PC because I want to be on a desktop PC , please stop trying to turn your program into a mobile application . I would be fine if they allowed us to continue using the classic version like they'd told us before . But apparently they rescinded that ! Back to Discord I go .
