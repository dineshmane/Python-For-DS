Unacceptable , but you can reinstall Skype 7
I have been using Skype for many years . Skype 8 is just awful . However , you can reinstall Skype 7 over the new version . If you do not have the old installer , search for SkypeFullSetup . exe or skype_7 . 40 . 0 . 104 . exe and install that . Do not upgrade again . There's a short announcement for Microsoft on a Skype support forum that the 1 September 2018 deadline no longer applies . Why is it bad ? Uses huge amounts of screen space ; many features of Skype Classic are missing . You cannot use a headset and have it ring on the PC speakers .
