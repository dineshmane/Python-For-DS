This . . Is . . . Genius
I am personally online very much of the day . Instead of owning a smartphone i just use skype , i have made a little list why i love skype . 1 . It's free . And i mean completly free , no " 2 hours a week-rule " 2 . It's easy , fast and reliable . 3 . Amazing sound quality . It will go as far as your microphone will . 4 . Webcam ? Share your screen ? They got it all .
