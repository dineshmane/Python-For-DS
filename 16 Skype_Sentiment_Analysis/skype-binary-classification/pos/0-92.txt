Absolute rubbish
Absolute rubbish . And being FORCED to use it is unacceptable . I have already cancelled my subscription . Cant find an 'away' status for contacts - only green online and nothing else . I want to know if my contacts are online and away so i can send them a message and at least have the knowledge that they may see it soon before logging off . Why make something that was good and very user friendly to a version that has important functions removed . Surely you should be adding - not subtracting ! Totally disgusted !
