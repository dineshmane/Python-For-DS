All the older versions worked perfectlyâ€¦
All the older versions worked perfectly but the new skype is horrible , before you could see the share screen and everyones cams at the same time and you could change their sizes but now this Ducking trash piece of chit microsoft only lets you see 1 window at a time , the connection is horrible even when my internet speed is over 100mbs The new skype is a complete piece of chit and should not have ever existed . Atleast if they were going to do a chit like this they shouldnt have blocked the old good versions . Its like microsoft wants everyone to kill themselves over the chit quality of skype .
