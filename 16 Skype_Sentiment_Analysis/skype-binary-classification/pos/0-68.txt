Skype used to be awesome
Skype used to be awesome . I remember the look in my father's eyes when he showed it to me , back when it came out . " One day , everybody will call each other like this , " He said . He was almost right , right until some update changed everything . Now , it is crap . The GUI is confusing , constricting , unclear . The software is slow and crashes a lot . I always resent when I have to use it , and I'm unfailingly boiling with rage over the software's F-ups by the time we get the call to work ( usually 1 hour after schedule ) . This is one hell of a sad story .
