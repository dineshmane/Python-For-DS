I've had a " paid " Skype number forâ€¦
I've had a " paid " Skype number for about 8 years with a monthly " subscription " and with every ( no fail ) " up-date " , it's gotten progressively worse . The " new & improved " begins with not ringing through for incoming calls so you're not aware that it's not working . Then comes the pop-up to " up-date " ( or it won't ring , but they don't tell you that ) . OK . Go for the " up-date " and numbers are lost , incoming calls still won't ring through AND , more often than not , voice messages are indicated but can't be found . Meanwhile , Skype's quick at grabbing the " fees " and " customer support " is completely absent . Any correspondence that's acknowledged is incredibly insulting , and obviously " foreign " . If ever there's a class action suit against the entire entity , I'll be in . They deserve to be sued at this point because it's not just " buggy " , at this juncture it's blatant thievery . If any-one finds a suitable alternative , I hope they post here , as a kindness ( that we don't receive from Skype ) to all .
