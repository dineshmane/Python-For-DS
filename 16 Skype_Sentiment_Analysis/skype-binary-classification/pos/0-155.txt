Never using Skype again
Skype used to work great . No idea why all the changes have been made but it's bull . I've been using Skype Messenger since 2010 and in the last year I've lost more posts , *missed* more posts and lost more information than ALL the other years combined . I'm switching to something else . It's F-ing ridiculous . I don't know what microsoft was thinking when they " upgraded " Skype but they need to fix it . They've lost me and my friends who use it for *good* .
