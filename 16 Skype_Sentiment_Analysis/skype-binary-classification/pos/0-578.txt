What can be better than seeing your grand children as and when you want to .
My grand children don't live close enough to me so Skype is my answer to having tea parties on screen with grand kids and there dolls/bears and who ever else is invited including bringing in other family on same chat , it is so brilliant as a family we have all sat chatting , watching the kids at play whilst drinking tea/coffee . I can think of nothing better apart from living next door to my family .
