Skype 8 is garbage .
Microsoft transformed Skype into a garbage app . I installed classic Skype 7 long time go and had to decline updates every time it asked ( There was an option to turn off updates , but MS removed it at some moment ) , but now it's over - Update or Quit . Shame on you Microsoft , you killed a good messenger .
