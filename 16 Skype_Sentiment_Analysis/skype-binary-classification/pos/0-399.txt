If I could give a 0 that is how I would rate the newest version of Skype/microsoft . I am at a lost to understand how such a terrific company could deteriorate so quickly . Let me say , I spent a good 6 hours trying to tackle the issues , one by one using the absurd " customer support " which is non - existent and expects the " community " to give answers . This is just blatant irresponsibility . Put PEOPLE back in the equation . Frankly , goodby e Skype .
