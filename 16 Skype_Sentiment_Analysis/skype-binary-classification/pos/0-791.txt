Innovative but no longer the best
As a long time user and paid subscriber to Skype , I have been somewhat annoyed with their customer service . On a few occasions recently I have tried to use the feedback or compliants form and almost in all cases it crashed . My biggest gripw is that it is no longer the cheapest service ( by some margin ) and there are several others that are stepping into the arena . I will be trying them soon .
