Skype online shop not greatest service
Update : After much time , many emails with requests and very bad reviews online , I finally managed to get my discount , so I change this review from 1 to 3 stars . Background : I was purchasing an item online , and it had a 20% discount on it . First of all , it took very long for Skype online shop to process my order . Second , they " forgot " about the discount . Then , when I contacted customer support , they assured me they would take care of it . Nothing happened . I asked and asked , they said they would deal with it . Month and a half - and nothing has happened ! Furthermore , as I live in Denmark with very high customs fees , I only wanted to buy something shipped out of Europe to avoid customs fees . This product was shipped out of Hong Kong , which they mentioned nothing about online . I contacted customer support also about this , and the same thing happened : They said they would deal with it , " rest assured " and other meaningless words , and nothing has ever happened . Finally , the product is not the quality that was described online at all ! The price for that product was way too high for its value . Be careful .
