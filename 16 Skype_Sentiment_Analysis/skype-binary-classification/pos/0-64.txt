Skype is now garbage . . dont use !
I was using Skype 7 ( Classic ) and had resisted updating , but this morning no choice and the update was " forced " on me-something I am really angry about . Instead of something that was simple , functional and reliable and helped my business , I have something that a teenager might use . Horrible interface , unable to use easily and way to easy to accidentally send emojis etc . Copying a conversation to quote to somebody else used to be a breeze , but now its a chore . Why oh why Microsoft have you imposed this monstrosity on people who ( judging by the overwhelming reviews on here ) simply don't want it ? ?
