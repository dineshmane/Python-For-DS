Just received an email from Skype informing me that 'your credit will become inactive in 7 days' , I then tried to login to my account of the same name / email address and , " That Microsoft account doesn't exist . Please enter a different account " . Credit and account gone . This also happened to my wife , she then created a 'new' Microsoft account in the same name and lost all of her contacts . . . . ripoff Idiots !
