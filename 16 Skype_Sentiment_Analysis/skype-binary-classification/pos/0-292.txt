The new Skype is useless
The new Skype is useless . Was asked to updated my classic Skype to a new version today and got a very different and completely useless version . First of all the window cannot be resized - so when sharing screen you see it so small that it is impossible to see anything . The video is portrait instead of landscape - and it cannot be changed . Not very useful if you use Skype for video conference with more than one person . Unfortunately , Microsoft has removed the classic Skype from the download page . : (
