Unbelievably obnoxious and notâ€¦
Unbelievably obnoxious and not personalized service . If you don't have a problems it works ok . However , if for any reason you stuck , technically or financially , you screwed . I had yearly subscription for unlimited calls . They suspected some fraud activities for whatever reason is . It took me 6 months and 4 hours of calls to remove the block of the account . Guess what , I requested to extend the subscription for 6 months that were paid for but unabled for use , they said NO . No explanation , but " unfortunately we won't extend and won't prorate " . Simple NO . Microsoft is obnoxious and ignorant empire , where customers worth nothing .
