I use Skype every day , very useful : Screen Sharing
I use it every day because of its quick and perfect text and voice communication with friends , allowing to send files and links with the text . I like to see , if a friend is online now . You also can help friends by viewing on their desktop about Skype . This Screen Sharing feature ( only in the newer Skype versions since version 4 . 1 ) is a similar function as the professional tool TeamViewer offers for this purpose .
