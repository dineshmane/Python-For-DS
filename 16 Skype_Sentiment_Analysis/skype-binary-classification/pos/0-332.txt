Skype has called the wrong number in myâ€¦
Skype has called the wrong number in my contacts even when i have explicitly typed in a different number not in contacts on multiple occasions . Keeps telling you to make call or your credit will expire . forcing you to spend against your will . Keeps telling you to updateCrap call quality nearly every time . In short , skype rips you off and the software is atrocious . Use something more modern not a badly maintained legacy piece of software probably written in BASIC .
