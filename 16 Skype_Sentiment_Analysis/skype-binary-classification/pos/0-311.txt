Absolutely terrible upgrade .
Absolutely terrible upgrade . We rely on Skype for day to day business , and I'm often left waiting 30 minutes to an hour for messages to send , the mobile and desktop versions clearly work at different rates , and a series of user-friendly features ( like copy and pasting chunks of conversation ) have been cancelled . It seriously affects our ability to operate and we are now looking at other software to channel our comms . How does a company release a product like this and hope to retain customers ? And why has it taken this long to fix these extremely obvious issues ? What a waste .
