From professional program to kids app
Skype used to the go-to program for any kind of professional communications . Unfortunately they decided to reposition Skype as a kids app ( like MSN was back in the day ) . The new version is far inferior to the previous one in almost every way . It is slow , the UI is unintuitive and half the options seem to be missing . It even lacks basic functionality such as the ability to search your conversation . People need a reliable and robust program that allows for instant messaging , calls , video calls and screen sharing . Previous version fulfilled that need most of the time . The new version fails miserably .
