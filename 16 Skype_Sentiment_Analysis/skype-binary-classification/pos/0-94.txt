Skype team - READ !
I rarely even register anywhere to make reviews but i am devastated by the stupidity of the team that approved such a version to reach LIVE in 21st century . This version is worse than Skype 1 . 0 and i am not exaggerating . And now to the details : - It is obvious that you have just merged the so called Lite version with the desktop one . The target group of Skype is people between 30 and 40 - this version is for teenagers that do not play around with the chat splits and resizable chat boxes . - Alt+Tab between the different chats on two screens was making Skype the only usable chat software up until now . - You have removed the resizing of the reply section , why ? Because you removed the chat splits of course . . . - The update itself - is your product manager from North Korea ? I haven't seen such a MUST-INSTALL-OR-I-WILL-CLOSE-THE- PROGRAM update since 2003 . Not to mention the animated actors greeting me for successfully obeying to the ORDER of installing this downgrade of Skype - all are from different colors except for the white guy who , according to Skype , is handicapped ? ? ? - The only positive thing is that you have actually realized that even in non-splitable chats you are wasting my time by making me click on the reply SECTION in order for skype to allow me to start typing . This was relevant for your previous version - now it is fixed and the cursor is there blinking once you change the names - WOW , enormous update ! Seriously at least allow your users to downgrade to previous versions . I assume you have migrated skype to a completely new architecture and this is quite impossible but before doing that your team must have studied the most used features of your program . This version is making everyone work slower than before .
