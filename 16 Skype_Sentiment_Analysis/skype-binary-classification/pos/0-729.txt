Really handy that it works on iPhone
Works really well for face to face calls . iPhone FaceTime is probably better quality image but no good if the other person doesn't have an Apple product like iPhone or iPad ! Fantastic when you're in another continent since you can load up credit and call to a land line back home at much lower rates . You can even set it up so that your own phone number appears when you call that person back home .
