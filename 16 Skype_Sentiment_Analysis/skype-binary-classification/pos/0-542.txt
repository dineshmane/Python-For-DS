It doesn't replace MSN at all . . .
Skype has been a horrible experience so far , it doesn't replace MSN at all . While MSN provides comfortable chatting with friends with more free customizations , Skype is only convenient for video call . It doesn't take into consideration user's other needs as a messenger . I want to make my chatting window smaller so i can chat and watch vid at the same time , Skype screen smallest size still takes over half the screen . I want to customize my text into different color depending on who i chat with , I can't . I want to change background of my chat room I can't . Skype is so fucking boring , the only reasonable feature it provides is video call . It doesn't cater to none call related users who simply want a light IM messenger free of charge .
