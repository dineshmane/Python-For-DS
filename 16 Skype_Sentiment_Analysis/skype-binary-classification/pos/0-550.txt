Skype Gives You Malware
Skype has added malware to its software that takes control of your computer and prevents it from accessing Google and Gmail and takes over your browsers to require that you use Babylon , a malware search engine . Skype downloaded Babylon , Bloson , Price Beep and Password Box , as well as several other malware programs , all for the sake of their making a few cents off these malicious programs . Skype's anti-service and anti-user practices are reprehensible and deserving of stern condemnation . It took a half day to remove the malicious programs Skype caused my computer to be infected with . I caution anyone considering using Skype to use great caution when downloading the service .
