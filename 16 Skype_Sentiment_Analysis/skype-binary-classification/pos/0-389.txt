I deeply dislike the new Skype
I deeply dislike the new Skype . Why did you take away he " away " option ? ! now if I use skype on the phone I have to let my hone open all the time if I want to be visible online , do you know how much that drains my battery . before if I was online but then turned my phone off I was still online in Skype and visible and available and people could reach me , now they think that I am not available . I just want Skype to have the old yellow " away " option that was so incredibly useful and practical ! ! !
