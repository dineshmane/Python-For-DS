The new version 8 . xx is complete crap
The new version 8 . xx is complete crap : awful user iterface , lack of customizations available in the classic edition , slow & unstable . How Microsoft own product can break Windows design rules by putting " close " button on top LEFT corner of windows ? Who invented the ugly controls ? Shame ! Shame ! Shame ! After I finish my already purchesed Skype credits I uninstall and don't return .
