Another fine mess , Microsoft . . .
Used to use it and it was fine for a free program . Didn't use it for a couple of years . Then Microsoft bought it . . . *gigantic sighing sound*Heard it was now full of ads and impaired functionality . I was informed or found out that my account had been hacked or something , nice going Microsoft . Their recovery process involved me having to specify the date that I first installed skype , to the month . I couldn't remember the year that I installed it - I hadn't used it for 2 - let alone the exact month . So even though I could name all my contacts by first and last name , and email , from memory , and obviously had access to the email address I signed up for skype with and was using it for this recovery process , they wouldn't let me back in . Because I couldn't remember the exact month I first installed it . " Oh yes , now I'm likely to sign up for another account on this competent application from this competent company " â€” said no one ever .
