Dont touch with a barge pole
Rubbish company living in the past : - Can't have a UK wide number as they have run out - I would have to take a number allocated for a different region in the UK ( not suitable for business ) - Can't change a personal account to a business account- Awful customer support - only online chat available which takes forever . Utter Rubbish ! !
