What is there now is not Skype
I have used Skype for years . It was a wonderful service and solved so many problems for me . What is there now is not Skype . It does not deserve the name . Its disappearing makes me sad . It was a good thing . What is there now is some version of a non communication nightmare that has no real customer service but rather endless loops . It is possible that you will be charged for something you do not want to be charged for . It is unlikely you will be able to file the form to get it back . You will want to close your account . You will become bewildered about how to do so . You will try and try to follow the loop to customer support , be forced to join Microsoft something or other while so doing . That will not help you . You will be switched back and forth across web and non-web Skype and into microsoft verification forms endlessly . I largely feel neutral about Bill Gates and how he has earned his fortune and then gives from it . I did admire the giving piece . This fake Skype changed that for me . His affiliation with this product , bewilders me . It is truly terrible now and feels like it steals from people by how it charges and evades - recourse . He would do well to discontinue his affiliation with it soon before it really damages his reputation .
