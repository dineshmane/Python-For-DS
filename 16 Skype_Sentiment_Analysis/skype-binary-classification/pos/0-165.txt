Truly Awful - Do Not Use
I have tried to set up a Skype account and it is the worst customer experience I have had in a long time . I first try to do so using my mobile number , it says that this number is already registered to an account , which it isn't ( as far as I'm aware ) . As a result I try signing in with the same number and it says " account doesn't exist " ! I try to remove my mobile number entirely form their records so I can " start again " . However , it doesn't let you remove a number without signing in , which I can't do because I don't have an account ! Next I try signing in with my email address ( which is a personal domain ) and again it doesn't let me because Skype only accepts Microsoft accounts . I try looking for a customer support number I can ring so I can try and remove my mobile number from their system/records . Apparently there isn't one , meaning that I can't create an account with my mobile number or email address . Terrible experience , I would like to think that this comment will be picked up and they can take the comments on board , however , given the fact I am one of 800+ negative reviews I highly doubt this .
