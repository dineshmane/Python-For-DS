My reply to Skype after a frustrating â€¦
My reply to Skype after a frustrating hour tying to log into my account and going round in circles . I am so angry I have been using Skype for years and now problems . I can't begin to explained all the trouble I am having just loging into my account So please donate the remainder of my Skype credit to charity I have had enough ! Since Microsoft has taken over it has been an absolute nightmare to use .
