new skype 8 sucks horrid !
new skype 8 sucks horrid ! - no chatbox resize possibility- totally overloaded chatbox surroundings too , with way too many stuff nobody really needs- messages take years to load and go through , microsoft is a joke to release something like this to the public- it just is slow slow , it lags lags , i never had such delays and lags with any prior skype version , everything was perfect until 7 . 42 version for 10 years and now look at this new skype 8 nothing worse ever made .
