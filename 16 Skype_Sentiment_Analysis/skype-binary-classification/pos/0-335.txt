2003's version of this was better than the actual one , no jokes .
I am a skype user since Beta . And you know what ? even beta version was better than this . crashes , audio bugs and/or crashes , even OS crashes ( although it might be as well the poorly coded windows 10 ) , horrible lag ( i have a 200Mbit internet connection ) and i can go on forever . i suppose because the so called " developers " are just too focused on collecting your data instead of delivering what the software is supposed to do . TLDR : we are in 2018 and skype sucks worse than its 2003 version . enough said
