My exerience with skype is terrible
My exerience with skype is terrible . I had 2 skype accounts and skype deducted 10 Euro every month since 2017 . As I cannot log into my old account I was not able to stopp the payments . The customer service was terrible . After nearly 2 hours on the chatline - eventually they said that they would stop my payments . I am still not able to log into this old account despite giving them all information . ( Payments transaction numbers etc . I have lost a lot of money and will probably never see it again . I will not use Skype anymore as it is really a scam . They prey on vulnerable people and make is so difficult to deal with . It took many times before I managed to get a customer chat person . Did not work on my PC . Kept saying there is an error etc . All types of excuses and technical issues . . Stay away from Skype is my advice to anybody . I am using Tesco now . Calls are only 1 cent / minute for Germany and many other countries . I hope skype will stopp clearing out my bank account . Not sure what else to do .
