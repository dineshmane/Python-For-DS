Account Hacked and lack of support from Skype unreal . . . It's a Groundhog Day experience
So my Skype account is hacked which is upsetting , worrying and scary . You want a quick resolution to this to put your mind at rest . But the Microsoft owned Skype add fuel to the flames of worry but making it almost impossible to contact them . When you do you need to complete a form so detailed and asking for information that many would never remember that the experience is like Groundhog Day or deja vu all over again . Not surprisingly this leads nowhere other than repeating the same proces time and time again ergo reference to Groundhog Day . In complete and utter desperation I wanted to cancel my Skype account which is a hard as quitting LinkedIn who are also now owned by Microsoft . I actually think that you should be able to buy an anti-Microsoft Virus Software for ALL Microsoft Companies , as once you allow this behemoth onto your PC , Tablet it's harder to get rid of than Japanese knotweed . The irony of this situation , given its VOIP , is that it's impossible to call them which would make life easier and remove the on-going stress Skype causes in these situations . In such a litigious age maybe if someone took legal action against them for the resultant stress they cause it might set a precedent for others ! Truly awful experience and 8 months still unresolved .
