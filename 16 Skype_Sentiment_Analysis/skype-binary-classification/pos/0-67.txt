Non-existent customer service and help ; refusal to provide a refund
Having been advised I needed to seek a refund of my Skype Credits or to reactivate them , I followed the instructions - which didn't exist . I then tried contacting support - and there was no email . So a 30 second task became about 40 minutes before giving up . Next day , 20 minutes in , and I surrendered and tried the customer services " chat " again . An hour later , and the assistant had achieved nothing , but to advise me that in August last year , they were going to refund my credits , but didn't . I never managed to deal with his supervisor , as I was running late for a meeting . Before I left I asked for them to contact me via email , with confirmation the refund would be forthcoming immediately , as to refuse now - c . 5 months after they said it would be provided was not legal , and that should I sue , they would lose , and additional compensation would be due - as well as the additional costs . I haven't heard anything , so I am guessing Skype prefer to be sued than honour their legal obligations . ======3 months later , and the UK CEO of Microsoft has failed to reply to a message ; the CEO of Microsoft has failed to reply to numerous emails ; the Head of UK Legal Services was sent a letter ( yes , that was the only option ) which was also ignored . Maybe 6 days a week , Microsoft close my case without doing anything , thinking that is the " right " thing to do , so I write back explaining that the ONLY outcome will be for reimbursement , as they committed to it , plus compensation , which merely increases as the bullying , delays and harassment increase . Soon , lawyers will be employed , which will substantially increase their costs .
