Terrible customer service with no actual resolution .
I called customer support to rectify a situation where I've had two existing subscriptions . A 1 month and a 3 month . . . these should not even co-exist and I don't know how they both existed . Lag time between canceling , switching or somehow they both were created at the same exact time . I usually get 3-4 e-mail confirmations about the same transaction from my e-mail and phone about the transaction so it's easily dismiss-able to WHICH transaction is being taken place . I contacted the customer service , not only where they condescending , they make it entirely your fault despite admitting for having a faulty system at that time and stating that it no longer does that now . I have screenshots of the conversation as it won't let me have a transcript , possibly from the terrible customer service they provide . I asked for a refund and told them that there was a greater issue than just bandaging the current issue at hand . I asked him to cancel all my subscriptions and it became apparently hostile . After I received the cancellation confirmation and told him so , he immediately disconnected , completely unprofessional . If this individual couldn't handle my case or issue , I should have been sent to someone that could either come to a better resolution instead of hanging up immediately . Absolutely terrible .
