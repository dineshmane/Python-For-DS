Great idea for those who live abroad
Not sure Iif my mums loves skype even more than me , hehe , since I have an account I call home more often and in the last year I even can see my family with the webcam . . . It definitely improved communications internationally . and is so cheap ! or even free ! However it sometimes have signal problems or echo
