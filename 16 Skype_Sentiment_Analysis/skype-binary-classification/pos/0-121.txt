Microsoft ruined Skype
Never had a problem with Skype until Microsoft bought it . Microsoft forces you to create a Microsoft account before you create a Skype account . I did that two years ago with a phone number . Last month that number was deactivated . I simply wanted to change the number . In order to access my account Microsoft sent security codes to the deactivated number . Morons . So , I go to chat and they confirm my identity but tell me it will be 30 days until they contact me about my security information . Out of frustration I chose to close the account and create a new one . They could not close the account . The rep gave me two options . He said I could contact the phone company and have the number reactivated to they could send the code or to just not use the account for one year and then it would be deleted . Unbelievable . All because my phone number changed . Microsoft has no good system in place to deal with a changed phone number . The platform is slow , stupid , time consuming and extremely frustrating .
