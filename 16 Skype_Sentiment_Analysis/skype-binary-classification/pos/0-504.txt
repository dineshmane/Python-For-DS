Confusing interface - poor quality
IMO - the whole Skype & S4B platform falls very short of a valid business solution . Microsoft have spent billions developing this product suite for it to be entirely lacklustre . Even the remote app is a pain to use , it doesnt do some UI niceties such as carriage return when sending an IM . The system is slow and integration with Outlook extremely poor . As a comparison , the good ole fashion MSN Messenger was a far better and more simplistic package . If we now compare any of the Skype editions to a modern competitor such as WhatsApp - it's way behind the times with integration , speed and device support . Come on Microsoft - SORT IT OUT ! ! ! !
