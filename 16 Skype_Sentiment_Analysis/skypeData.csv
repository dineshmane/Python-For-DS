Makes Windows Vista look like a…	Makes Windows Vista look like a masterpiece.Typical Microsoft ill-conceived, badly executed garbage. Trying quitting this steaming pile of @#$3, good luck! Assuming, of course, it hasn't crashed for no obvious reason or any reason it cares to tell you about.User-interface that is perfect for torturing terrorism suspects	2019-05-06	1
All the older versions worked perfectly…	All the older versions worked perfectly but the new skype is horrible, before you could see the share screen and everyones cams at the same time and you could change their sizes but now this Ducking trash piece of chit microsoft only lets you see 1 window at a time, the connection is horrible even when my internet speed is over 100mbs The new skype is a complete piece of chit and should not have ever existed. Atleast if they were going to do a chit like this they shouldnt have blocked the old good versions. Its like microsoft wants everyone to kill themselves over the chit quality of skype.	2019-05-06	1

Account debacle	Logging into Skype has turned into a real debacle. The incompetent MS team has created the perfect trap for the elderly user. The trap is set by something as innocent (and very frequent for the elderly) as forgetting your own password. This is used by Skype as an opportunity to suggest to the user to create a MS account with which to log into Skype. After the unsuspected user agrees, the trap closes in. His entire history and friends list in his old account are rendered inaccessible. Moreover, even years later when the user tries to log into to the old account, his current account is rendered inaccessible. Skype gets into an infinite loops saying that the user account or password are incorrect. This happens even after the user changes the password of his current account through sms authentication. This entire thing us cursed. Avoid!	2019-04-27	1

new skype 8 sucks horrid!	new skype 8 sucks horrid!- no chatbox resize possibility- totally overloaded chatbox surroundings too, with way too many stuff nobody really needs- messages take years to load and go through, microsoft is a joke to release something like this to the public- it just is slow slow, it lags lags, i never had such delays and lags with any prior skype version, everything was perfect until 7.42 version for 10 years and now look at this new skype 8 nothing worse ever made.	2019-04-24	1
Video with no problems, chats crash occasionally	I have been using Skype for chatting with colleagues, but it crashes from time to time and I need to restart it and wait for it to load. With calls I had no problems.	2019-04-23	4

Skippy is dead	Skippy is dead. RIP Skippy. When I try and sign in only my email of 10 years ago comes up. Poor Skippy. I have tried about 10 times now to reset password and email. New email works. Skippy barked. But the password does not. Skippy Farted. So this is called a circle of hell. There are no more humans at microsoft so I am not prepared to spend another hour on useless forums. Bye bye Skippy. You are dust	2019-04-19	1

A shadow of it's former self	Skype has just gone downhill after being bought by Microsoft, the new UI is pretty terrible and constantly shifting arround the buttons is just annoying. Still, it gets the job done when you need to call someone.	2019-04-17	3
Skype is the WORST product you hate to…	Skype is the WORST product you hate to LOVE. If it weren't for the constant forced updates, the shifting of the buttons and everything else, it would be horrible. I receive at least 10 spam calls every single day! It's the best part about it really. Then one time, I tried to delete my skype phone number. That was great. I couldn't, and even more, I can't even keep people from calling me! Talk about customer satisfaction. Imagine. This is the most technical company on the planet (Microsoft) and we can't delete a number immediately. And people think we went to the moon!!  HAHAHAHA.	2019-04-15	5
Skype is just so bad now a the hands of MS.	"Why oh why every time I go to use Skype do I have to re-learn its interface because of yet another ""clever"" idea.  Used to be so simple to use, now Microsoft have their hands on it, its just infuriating to work with."	2019-04-15	1
Ruined Skype with new forced update	Skype Classic was a perfect, simple to use tool. Now Microsoft is forcing an update that removed key features and has now become an electron app that is unacceptable. Microsoft also ignores everyone's request to bring back the original classic and now forces people to use their terrible new version. Shame what has happened to Skype.	2019-04-13	1
sucks	sucks.  Logs out all the time.	2019-04-10	1
No longer a useful tool	Used to be a light, functional and useful little assistant for work and family - MS has ignored its seasoned user base requests for a version of Classic to be available to those who want it and proceed to force features, privacy invasions and updates.  I will be putting in as much energy in encouraging my contacts to switch to any other app as i once put into promoting Skype until and unless MS provides a reasonable version.. if you want to know what that entails then look at V7 and previous.	2019-04-05	1
It is truly sad to see what has…	It is truly sad to see what has happened to skype since Microsoft acquired it.  Years ago there were some connection quality issues caused by very variable data-connection-quality (not skype's fault). Now there is just a merry-go-round of patches and up(down?)grades with each release becoming less good than it's predecessor. At the moment I cannot get any notification of receiving messages and my calls randomly drop out - only reestablishing 70% of the time. My contacts' status indications are rarely accurate. Despite having a 28-50Mb connection.Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves. I am now going to have to move to WhatsApp - which I have resisted for a couple of years, but now my 'experience has been improved' in Skype to the point that I give in.	2019-04-04	1

Not good for business	Bad. Constantly needs to reinstall. Password reset texts don't arrive. Really inconvenient to use across multiple devises. Was good once.	2019-04-02	1
An insult to its users	Now uses an interface that insults its users with imbecilic graphics one can't disable, contact list so pointless (it 'helpfully' heads each name with the first letter) that one has to scroll down to see them all, a constant demand to update every time it is opened without- again, showing its contempt for its users- any opportunity to disable... Am now trying other substitutes that don't employ childish emojis and focuses on appearing serious and professional.	2019-03-29	1
Skype was reliable back when I…	Skype was reliable back when I purchased a phone number, 13 years ago. Now the software is so slow that when I try to answer the phone, the caller gives up and hangs up before the software responds.Also, there is no way for the notification number to go away, when there is a new message. Once you get a message, the number stays with the Skype taskbar icon until you shut the software down, no matter how many times you open the chat with the new message.Because of the software issues, I'd have dumped this service years ago, but the phone number I purchased is the contact number we gave a lot of companies and vendors.	2019-03-22	1
charged me twice on my subscription…	charged me twice on my subscription when i tried to complain they said they can only deal by chat and said if they refunded me i would lose my Skype number DO NOT USE THEM FOR NUMBERS	2019-03-21	1
Will not be renewing my subscription	"I am a paid subscriber and have been with Skype for several years. I am a desktop user. When Skype 8 came out I kept switching back to Skype 7 because version 8 was terrible. No individual chat windows, no customizable hot keys, could not resize the text input area, no font choices like font face and size. They eventually rolled out split window but only for the huge clunky windows 10 app and not for the desktop version.  Finally they forced users clinging to their fully functional version 7 into the terrible version 8 which lacks so many features of version 7 that it's not an ""upgrade"" at all it's a serious downgrade. They are not listening to the users who have voted highly on Uservoice for either the return of version 7 or to add the missing features into the version 8 desktop client (not the app).  This is unacceptable for people who paid for the service and for people who use this product for work and cannot get usual tasks done because some of the features they rely heavly upon have been removed."	2019-03-21	1
This is how a corporation like…	"This is how a corporation like Microsoft may destroy a good software. Skype has been for a long time a perfect communication tool. Then, Microsoft bought it, made really bad ""improvements"" and now Microsoft does not allow the use of older versions."	2019-03-21	1
Seriously Microsoft this is so sad	Seriously Microsoft this is so sad. I usually dont write reviews but this app was bothering me know for months. First of all is the new UX design totally retarde d. I am a paying customer for Skype to Phone and took me a long time to find out how to even make a phonecall. The whole UX is very unpleasant. Then once i forgot my password. OMG what a drama to recover it. Had to solve some weird puzzles and then choose a password that i never used before. Who came up with this??? Thats the reason why people forget their passwords if you make them choose weird ones. Anyway now the design changed again and i am trying to pay for my Skype to Phone credit since its almost on 0. But guess what? I cannot find it. I am switching between the microsoft account and the skype account and i cannot find where to make the payment t. I only see the ret arded option to add 5 USD via auto recharge. But thats not what i want. Seriously guys, what a major fuckup. Totally lost my patience. I already thought that maybe i am just to stupid but then i check the reviews here and everybody has the same problems. Microsoft this is so sad. I was using your software since i was a child. Playing Fifa 98 on my Windows computer and so on. Everybody at my company already switched to Apple but I was like no I am used to Windows and i love it. But after today i am done with you Microsoft. Nice fucku p, seriously....	2019-03-21	1
Skype version 8.41 is the worst version to dates	Just been forced to upgrade to the latest Skype version 8.41.... what a load of rubbish... why cant they leave it alone, this version is worse than the previous one (and that one was crap) and appears to have less functionality.The most annoying thing with this new version is the lack of ability to resize the incoming video a text at the same time.It turns on my speakers when i have purposely turned them offI cant see myself when video and texting.	2019-03-20	1

My exerience with skype is terrible	My exerience with skype is terrible. I had 2 skype accounts and skype deducted 10 Euro every month since 2017. As I cannot log into my old account I was not able to stopp the payments. The customer service was terrible. After nearly 2 hours on the chatline - eventually they said that they would stop my payments. I am still not able to log into this old account despite giving them all information. (Payments transaction numbers etc. I have lost a lot of money and will probably never see it again. I will not use Skype anymore as it is really a scam. They prey on vulnerable  people and make is so difficult to deal with. It took many times before I managed to get a customer chat person. Did not work on my PC.  Kept saying there is an error etc. All types of excuses and technical issues. . Stay away from Skype is my advice to anybody. I am using Tesco now. Calls are only 1 cent / minute for Germany and many other countries. I hope skype will stopp clearing out my bank account. Not sure what else to do.	2019-03-16	1
Absolutely atrocious	"Absolutely atrocious. Microsoft bought up a serious communication tool and replaced it with a social media app for kids. When I say ""replaced"", I mean replaced. Skype 8 isn't a new version of the same program, it's a new, crappy chat app that steals the Skype brand, and they've killed the original Skype we knew and loved.What makes it truly unusable for a purpose for which I've been using it for years is that I need to be able to access old chat history in an organized manner, but Microsoft has simultaneously taken away local storage, placed a time limit on the history, taken away the ability to ""jump back"" to earlier times, and made it impossible to copy more than a couple of screenfuls at a time. Also, small amount you can copy no longer comes out in an organized fashion with bracketed time/date stamps at the beginning of each message. The copied/pasted text doesn't show dates, and is messy and hard to read. At the same time they've taken this away, they've also taken away the ability to export chat history.So they've basically limited it to real time chat and SCREWED everyone who was relying on it for record keeping. Sure, we can find other programs, but we chose Skype because of the features that it had, and now we lose data continuity because of Microsoft's arrogance and callousness.There is absolutely no excuse for treating users like this. Microsoft clearly doesn't care how disruptive it is to people's lives to take away features by the boatload and force unnecessary changes down people's throats in programs that they RELY on. It's not ""an inconvenience"", as their reps patronizingly call it, it has a real impact on important aspects of people's lives. This is not only making me abandon Skype and convince other people to abandon it, it makes me mistrust Microsoft's brand by showing that they can't be relied on to maintain a consistent feature set and they bully their users.I didn't even need them to continue developing and improving Skype Classic, I just needed them to continue patching any new security issues and otherwise leave it the hell alone. Even that was apparently too much to ask!STAY AWAY FROM SKYPE AND AVOID MICROSOFT SOFTWARE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU!Now excuse me while I go and do something I should have done a long time ago...install Linux on my primary computer. And this is coming from someone with an MCSE certification."	2019-03-16	1
From Gold to Dirt	I was kind of okay with having to downgrade once Skype 8 was rolled out, Skype 8 is utter garbage and is missing core functions and feels dumbed down in very unintuitive ways, what a waste of energy and money to make something NOBODY WANTS, you have improved nothing and nobody appreciates what you have done here Micro$oft, how do you not get it, do you even read these reviews?Now i get a message that i cannot use skype unless i update it to the new horrible sh!tshow, and as i dislike being shovel fed by people who think they know whats best for me even when me and many others don't agree, not allowing me choice in the matter i am going to stop using the application, Microsoft is seriously out of touch.The original dev team must be so sad.	2019-03-16	1

I HATE the new version of Skype	If I could rate less than one star, I would.Skype used to be a simple and easy way to keep in touch with loved ones who live far away. Now, it is buggy, complicated, and in all aspects, AWFUL.I mostly used it for the fact that you can video call and share screens, and unfortunately, I can’t find any other app that runs the way the old skype did. I am so aggravated with Microsoft.It is the worst application I have ever come across and I am severely disappointed in Skype.	2019-03-08	1
How awful is the new Skype?	"How awful is the new Skype?I cannot count the ways.Old version worked beautifully Whenever I was running low in my ""wallet,"" I simply topped up and carried on as usual. Now I have to ""Subscribe.""Internal applications have been moved all over the place in counterintuitive ways.If I ran my business with the tone deafness and utter arrogance of Microsoft, I would be out of business within a week.Millions of users have complained on message boards, and the response of the M$ moderators is to say, ""Your concerns have been noted,"" and promptly lock the thread.I used ooVoo for other users with ooVoo and found it worked incredibly well for users for all over the world, and Skype for international calls for people not on the app.Remember King Midas? Everything he touched turned to gold. Well, think of Microsoft as the mirror image of King Midas. Everything it lays its hands on turns to, well, do the math, dear reader, do the math."	2019-03-05	1

"I've had a ""paid"" Skype number for…"	"I've had a ""paid"" Skype number for about 8 years with a monthly ""subscription"" and with every (no fail) ""up-date"", it's gotten progressively worse. The ""new & improved"" begins with not ringing through for incoming calls so you're not aware that it's not working. Then comes the pop-up to ""up-date"" (or it won't ring, but they don't tell you that). OK. Go for the ""up-date"" and numbers are lost, incoming calls still won't ring through AND, more often than not, voice messages are indicated but can't be found. Meanwhile, Skype's quick at grabbing the ""fees"" and ""customer support"" is completely absent. Any correspondence that's acknowledged is incredibly insulting, and obviously ""foreign"". If ever there's a class action suit against the entire entity, I'll be in. They deserve to be sued at this point because it's not just ""buggy"", at this juncture it's blatant thievery. If any-one finds a suitable alternative, I hope they post here, as a kindness (that we don't receive from Skype) to all."	2019-02-24	1

Version 8 is a total nightmare where they have taken away the ability to have your contacts and chat window panes as two seperate windows. Now these are combined where you can only view one or the other! Added to this, a lot of the menus have been removed to make Skype (as they say) more user friendly. I personally believe this is untrue and just an excuse by Microsoft to limit what we can and can't do. Having been a Skype user for many, many years, I have now uninstalled the software and am moving to another product that actually listens to customers and understands their wants or needs. Reading a multitude of threads, Version 8 of Skype is vastly unpopular and Microsoft seem oblivious to this.	2019-02-11	1

Horrible interface, unable to use easily and way to easy to accidentally send emojis etc. Copying a conversation to quote to somebody else used to be a breeze, but now its a chore.

Non-existent customer service and help; refusal to provide a refund	"Having been advised I needed to seek a refund of my Skype Credits or to reactivate them, I followed the instructions - which didn't exist.I then tried contacting support - and there was no email. So a 30 second task became about 40 minutes before giving up.Next day, 20 minutes in, and I surrendered and tried the customer services ""chat"" again.An hour later, and the assistant had achieved nothing, but to advise me that in August last year, they were going to refund my credits, but didn't. I never managed to deal with his supervisor, as I was running late for a meeting.Before I left I asked for them to contact me via email, with confirmation the refund would be forthcoming immediately, as to refuse now - c. 5 months after they said it would be provided was not legal, and that should I sue, they would lose, and additional compensation would be due - as well as the additional costs.I haven't heard anything, so I am guessing Skype prefer to be sued than honour their legal obligations.======3 months later, and the UK CEO of  Microsoft has failed to reply to a message; the CEO of Microsoft has failed to reply to numerous emails; the Head of UK Legal Services was sent a letter (yes, that was the only option) which was also ignored.Maybe 6 days a week, Microsoft close my case without doing anything, thinking that is the ""right"" thing to do, so I write back explaining that the ONLY outcome will be for reimbursement, as they committed to it, plus compensation, which merely increases as the bullying, delays and harassment increase.Soon, lawyers will be employed, which will substantially increase their costs."	2019-01-30	1
Skype used to be awesome	"Skype used to be awesome. I remember the look in my father's eyes when he showed it to me, back when it came out. ""One day, everybody will call each other like this,"" He said. He was almost right, right until some update changed everything. Now, it is crap. The GUI is confusing, constricting, unclear. The software is slow and crashes a lot. I always resent when I have to use it, and I'm unfailingly boiling with rage over the software's F-ups by the time we get the call to work (usually 1 hour after schedule). This is one hell of a sad story."	2019-01-30	2

The new version is klutzy - e.g. several clicks to delete chats one by one!?? Very difficult to do anything. Nothing is intuitive. What happened to the useful symbol 'away'? Now I can only put 'invisible'. I used 'away' when I wanted to talk to just one person.  When I call skype to skype, there is an annoying beating heart symbol at the bottom of the video screen. Very irritating. When I was forced to upgrade (downgrade, actually), names of old contacts I had removed years ago appeared in my contacts list. I can find no way to remove them - only block them. My contacts list gets cluttered with a list of conversations I've made, and I can only remove those one by one. I could go on indefinitely about the bad features. What kind of morons designed this new version?! I will be migrating from skype as soon as I find an intelligent replacement.	2019-01-25	1
Since I was forced to change to Version…	Since I was forced to change to Version 8 I have hardly used Skype. In fact I find it pretty well unusable except for phoning landlines. I find the wave feature childish and irritating, and I would turn it off if I could. Skype used to be a great product. Such a shame!	2019-01-25	1
Ever sense Microsoft has purchased…	Ever sense Microsoft has purchased Skype the service has gootten worse, the new desktop app is less reliable, they took away all of abilities to save conversations or not, I don't appreciate  the data mining they are doing and reading my conversations. Microsoft really doesn't care about the user anymore. This co-insides with the view on Windows 10.	2019-01-24	1
horrible new update	Why does every version of skype keep getting worse.  ifi wanted facebook messenger id use that.  So long skype, ill be finding an alternative until they come to their senses.	2019-01-24	1
If I wanted to use a version of…	"If I wanted to use a version of Facebook Messenger, I would, but I don't.  Ever since Microsoft purchased Skype you guys have been shooting yourselves in the foot, over and over. MS bought Skype, then merged it with Microsoft Messenger, and they killed that off. That was bad enough, as I used to keep those to lists of people separate for a reason. Then came the idiotic updates that stripped features and controls away from the user. Switch off automatic updates even though what you're using is working flawlessly?  Oh hell no! Trying to use the excuse of security?  Nope, it's not Microsoft's or Skype's job to keep MY computer safe. That's my job. I don't need a nanny.But this latest stunt of shutting down Skype, and being FORCED to update with this silly popup saying ""You haven't updated in a long time"" or else.  Really?  I checked via certain programs and v7x and v8x both access the same servers/relays, so it can't be you're 'retiring' it because of that.  So KNOCK THE CRAP OFF!  I didn't update in a long time because what I had worked fine!  So, leave off the forced updating, or revamp that tacky, obnoxious, loathsome Facebook Messenger Wanna be GUI and give us the option to have a ""Classic"" GUI, or there will still be thousands of formums with thousands (if not more) readers per forums, finding and using ways to bypass your bullying tactics."	2019-01-23	1
BAD? it's terrible, horrible, shocking, outrageous, atrocious, flagrant!	"I'm using skype since 2008, and i quit skype 1 months ago starting using telegram! why? i will summary the features of ""microsoft skype"" as below:1- crash all your chat history2- slow chat experience, losing connectivity every 2 minutes.3- laggy software just like internet explorer.Thanks microsoft for spoiling one of best software's ever."	2019-01-22	1

Probably the worst software application I’ve ever used	Skype 8 is a dreadful redesign of an application that in previous versions basically worked although it was never the same once Microsoft took it over.To say it has been dumbed down would be an understatement. Many things that used to work no longer do. Where is my chat history going back years? Why is searching within chat windows useless? Why does hovering emojis not show the shortcut anymore? Why does pasting an image into a chat window immediately deliver it without the failsafe need to press Enter first?An utterly appalling application that will hopefully be resigned to the scrap heap in the next few years as tools such as the infinitely superior Slack gain more traction.	2019-01-21	1
New Skype reflects on Who and What…	New Skype is Who Microsoft is today...they hire programmers from all over the world and turn the company over to them. Everybody knows Programmers no nothing about what Users want....There is No chance any serious Customer/Consumer input was sought or used in making these changes and this is what you get from people who don't even use the Software they produce. Smart companies would allow you to keep the old version, but Microsoft only listens to Voices that want new ones...No doubt any New they get will be a Net Loss. Big	2019-01-20	1
Skype 8 for windows desktop	Both thumbs down for version 8. Microsoft writes that the new version has all features from version 7 ..... the truth is that almost none of the important features are there.Compared to version 7, version 8 is a nightmare that Microsoft now forces millions of users to install if they will continue to use skype.	2019-01-20	1
Skype 8, the version that killed Skype for me.	"I have used Skype since 2004~2005 and never had a need for an alternative but, then Microsoft stepped in. Ever since then the quality and usability just kept going down hill, never ending troubleshooting. The few better features of Skype aren't worth the trouble, plenty of alternatives. I have been considering alternatives for a while and Skype 8 finally gave me the reason to move to something else. The forced update refused to work for me, couldn't get past the log in screen, was stuck on never ending load screen. With all the troubleshooting i had to do with Skype in the past year i just didn't bother anymore. ""Good job"" MS team responsible for Skype. They took something that was working fine and destroyed it. With Skype classic dead, Skype is dead. From the comments it seems its not just me, but quite a few average Skype users."	2019-01-19	1

Absolute rubbish	Absolute rubbish.  And being FORCED to use it is unacceptable.  I have already cancelled my subscription.Cant find an 'away' status for contacts - only green online and nothing else.  I want to know if my contacts are online and away so i can send them a message and at least have the knowledge that they may see it soon before logging off.  Why make something that was good and very user friendly to a version that has important functions removed.  Surely you should be adding - not subtracting!Totally disgusted!	2019-01-19	1
The worst programme ever?	One of the worst programmes I have ever had. Skype couple years ago use to be a simple tool for calling and they were good at it! Now its slow, not working, complicated, unreliable, integrated system that I recommend not to use. The invoicing system? Ridiculous. If you wanna contact somebody? You cannot, you only get automated messages... Once my license is done, I erase, delete, ban skype from my PC and life.btw. world unlimited calling to 63 destinations is pure lie as you can only call to 8 mobile lines.	2019-01-18	1
Skype team - READ!	I rarely even register anywhere to make reviews but i am devastated by the stupidity of the team that approved such a version to reach LIVE in 21st century. This version is worse than Skype 1.0 and i am not exaggerating. And now to the details:- It is obvious that you have just merged the so called Lite version with the desktop one. The target group of Skype is people between 30 and 40 - this version is for teenagers that do not play around with the chat splits and resizable chat boxes.- Alt+Tab between the different chats on two screens was making Skype the only usable chat software up until now.- You have removed the resizing of the reply section, why? Because you removed the chat splits of course...- The update itself - is your product manager from North Korea? I haven't seen such a MUST-INSTALL-OR-I-WILL-CLOSE-THE- PROGRAM update since 2003. Not to mention the animated actors greeting me for successfully obeying to the ORDER of installing this  downgrade of Skype - all are from different colors except for the white guy who, according to Skype, is handicapped???- The only positive thing is that you have actually realized that even in non-splitable chats you are wasting my time by making me click on the reply SECTION in order for skype to allow me to start typing. This was relevant for your previous version - now it is fixed and the cursor is there blinking once you change the names - WOW, enormous update!Seriously at least allow your users to downgrade to previous versions. I assume you have migrated skype to a completely new architecture and this is quite impossible but before doing that your team must have studied the most used features of your program. This version is making everyone work slower than before.	2019-01-18	1
Skype 8 is just plain horrid	Skype 8 is just plain horrid, what kind of trash is this?- No resizable chat text windows anymore? are you serious? i cant type on this tiny text bar, totally unacceptable!- No split chat windows- desktop version looks and feels like some web /mobile phone chat messenger, if i wanted to use a phone like software, then guess what we would do it.- No more multiple instances possible, i have more than one username, so why restrict it in all aspects..- only preset font sizes? why not allow users to choose their desired font size in numbers, no idea why skype tries to think for the user.- forced update? i hate when companies force update their (unfinished) softwares, im currently deciding on an alternative, one thing for certain i will not use skype 8 that is for very sure.bring back skype classic 7.41 it was all good with it, it wasnt broken so do not fix it.	2019-01-18	1

Sucks	Sucks! Was forced to update from a version I liked. The new version doesn't have split screen. Their solution was to tell us to use the Windows 10 version from the store. That one does have split screen but overall it is even worse. They don't listen to their users at all! Need to find something else to use.	2019-01-17	1
Forced to upgrade, new version terrible	Was forced to upgrade to the new skype, absolutely terrible layout	2019-01-17	1
Forced Skype update is totally useless	Skype once my favorite chat program ... no rendered to being useless!Today I got finally forced to upgrade from my Skype Classic. I had fended off the obnoxious upgrade messages for many months, because I knew that there wouldn't be split windows for multiple conversations any more with the new skype version  (that's why I had converted back to classic many months ago). Skype was a good program, then MS bought it and every since then there's only crap and problems with it. Just an example: in the Android Skype App (on my S8 Samsung) MS has still not managed to provide me with notifications for incoming skype messages (long lists of discussions about this on the internet as well). What good is a messenger for, that does not inform you of new things. Just one of many issues to wonder about, what BS are these MS developers creating?	2019-01-17	1

We cannot trust the 'new' generation	Not repeating what is missing in the 'new and enhanced' version, because it is just about everything everyone used. No-one wanted anything what they dumped in this 'new and enhanced' version, the one they created because the team 'listened to the customer' - ahum.I have never been complaining about a 'free' app and some bugs that came with it, BUT ... at some point MS started to integrate it as a Metro App in Win8, which was unusable, so you had to remove it and install the Desktop version (7), NOT 8! The bug was the Skype team, not the program!Then the updates came ... customers (non-IT) starting to call for support as they were lost in the 'enhanced' interface. Solution, uninstall and reinstall the Classic 7 version and, NEVER update!So far so good. Now, about 2 years later, some kids at MS developed a mobile targeted version, removing all great functionality Skype contained. Some manager must have found that this was a great idea, not to hurt their feelings I suppose, and MS decide to shove in our throats, whether we wanted or not. And now, we don't even have a choice anymore at all...Desktop Skype is ignored as if everyone is doing work on a smart phone or tablet! There are MILLIONS of Windows 10 and other PCs out there, used by people who do real work, and have real communications, all day long, every single day. And all that happened while MS is still claiming today they 'listened' to the users, yeah right...The new, young, brainless generation does not use Skype! But still, that is what MS aims for!Professionals, who build their communication with their customers around Skype are being totally ignored. Those are also the ONLY ones who actually did not mind paying for Skype Credit or get a personalized phone number.A lot of use are also losing business because of the way we communicated, customers switched and we do not always know to what if they don't tell us!So, thank you very much to the young generation, who just made sure they will NOT have a job anymore in a while, all for the sake of being 'modern' ...I fear Skype will just be left to die... Meanwhile, all Skype users are switching to something else, most to WhatsApp, and will never come back, smart move MS!	2019-01-16	1

New Skype is shocking, use another service if you can!	New Skype is absolutely shocking. Slow, full of bugs, all changes completely needless and have brought with them so many issues you have to ask yourself what are MS doing - do they not listen to feedback at all? Was finally FORCED to upgrade after staying on Skype 7 as long as possible (was cut off mid call and forced to upgrade). In the months since the new version's released Microsoft has done absolutely nothing to improve the product despite all the feedback from their loyal customers and still forces everyone to use this new garbage. Shame on you MS - if you wanted to create a new IM service aimed at kids, why didn't you do this and let the rest of us continue using an perfectly fine and serviceable product.	2019-01-15	1

Absolutely horrible	Absolutely horrible. Skype lags all of the time, and also kills my broadband connection whenever a video call comes in. I only know of an incoming call when it fails. Using the search field crashes the app half the time, and the other half it's so painfully slow it's not worth using. The new UI is horrible. This app has failed fantastically on so many levels I wonder if Microsoft is just secretly wanting to kill this business area for themselves by making the program such a complete PITA to use. It's really difficult to fail this thoroughly without trying.	2019-01-14	1

Don't fix something that isn't broken!	"Someone really needs to cup these devs over the ear and explain the ""if it isn't broken don't fix it"" rule to life.These clowns have taken what used to be a very efficient means of communication and completely ruined it. Firstly they removed the ability to separate chat windows. The previous option to split worked just fine for over a decade so no idea why they got clever there.Now if you wanted the split screen you have to download the windows 10 app.. now this version no longer allows you to minimise the app to the system tray. Although it runs perpetually in the background.Honestly I have no idea why they y we used to break something that worked just fine but I guess this is how devs stay in business.From my perspective, I think I'm done with Skype. WhatsApp provide a better pc/web version than Skype and I have now migrated across to there. Would have liked to stay with Skype but I simply cannot deal with all the incompetence from their product team. Maybe I'll return one day but it certainly won't be in the near future"	2019-01-02	1

Microsoft ruined Skype	Never had a problem with Skype until Microsoft bought it. Microsoft forces you to create a Microsoft account before you create a Skype account. I did that two years ago with a phone number. Last month that number was deactivated. I simply wanted to change the number. In order to access my account Microsoft sent security codes to the deactivated number. Morons. So, I go to chat and they confirm my identity but tell me it will be 30 days until they contact me about my security information. Out of frustration I chose to close the account and create a new one. They could not close the account. The rep gave me two options. He said I could contact the phone company and have the number reactivated to they could send the code or to just not use the account for one year and then it would be deleted. Unbelievable. All because my phone number changed. Microsoft has no good system in place to deal with a changed phone number. The platform is slow, stupid, time consuming and extremely frustrating.	2018-12-29	1

Update totally ruins Skype	Skype has been nagging me to install it's new version every time I turn on my laptop for over a year now but last night it decided to install without my permission while I was away from my computer and the result was absolute trash.Everything is slower and the interface is really ugly and so much worse, video chats are buggy and slower, the whole layout is messed up. Worst thing is I can't revert back to the old version of pre-2017 Skype so I'm stuck with this total garbage.I've been using Skype for a decade with no problems and I've really enjoyed Skype in the past, but the fact Skype forcibly installed this dumb update on my laptop without my permission AND the fact that it's universally worse than the old version of Skype is making me seek out alternatives. I've been trying out Viber and so far so good, I won't be using Skype again until they allow an option to revert back to the old version.To those of you who still have the old version of Skype, DO NOT INSTALL ANY UPDATES.	2018-11-15	1

Use and Application of Skype	It is an easy-to-use, convenient, safe, reliable tool that allows advanced communication between an organization / company or staff, with family members, friends who are out of the country or away from one's location. It is easy to download, it is not very expensive, it can do videoconferences and conferences, useful mainly for business in offices, to satisfy the requirements of customers, remote providers, it is compatible with almost all Windows operating systems, user quantities and have This Tool to facilitate the use between people, you can search through emails. It has had many improvements in the organization, especially in the level of communication, since there are managers and directors of the organization who are outside the country, and through this tool communication with them is achieved through video calls, constant communication with suppliers and customers without Using other more expensive tools, all members of the organization can have contacts with colleagues outside the company. I recommend this tool because it is very easy to use, is available on the website, has minimal costs, improves communication in an organization that is in various parts of the world, with respect to all the members of the human talent that is in it. creates new customers, new suppliers, it is necessary to educate so that its use is the most appropriate, to stay always updated with respect to the platforms of the operating systems in the computers for a better functioning and scope of this tool. I recommend all those people who want to work from their homes to achieve effective communication with their customers and suppliers and stay updated on the future business of the network.	2018-10-31	5

Skype: rudest most incompetent customer service and help people don't want to do their job.	I'd used skype for years with little issue but I've never needed to reach customer service. Recently my credit card didn't go through for a purchase (not the banks issue as I called my bank twice to confirm) and then when I went to the chat help (you can only use chat or email for support) they took me round and round.... Finally I was so fed up I found a number to call Microsoft who bought skype and they took me round and round too and in addition were incredibily rude, didn't listen, talked over me and generally really unpleasant to deal with then finally told me they'd only work with me through the chat whom I explained were not able to help me and I wasn't dealing with anymore after several days of getting no where using chat support. Totally stupid/time wasting situation.. Honestly, all they needed to do was cancel my transaction and/or take my card manually (which I am not able to do on my end). They didn't need to be rude and difficult to work with. Have lost me as a customer. I'll take my business elsewhere and I suggest you do the same.	2018-10-17	1
Complete Rubbish	If it were possible to give 0 stars I would. This piece of garbage is unusable. We resort to FB messenger now because at least it works! And is user friendly. Restore Skype to what is used to be - and conduct USER TESTING, that is, use people in the real world to actually test it before you put it onto the market. It's only a matter of time before people stop using it completely.	2018-10-16	1
Even worse than the last!!!	Every new version of skype is worse than the previous ones.  I use the desktop version. It's a design nightmare.  Ugly beyond belief. Very difficult to use.  Stupid symbols all over the place, like an insect infestation. Endless useless or incomprehensible options.One thing is obvious:  the perpetrators of this mess just LOVE to complicate things.  If they been asked to mess up skype they could not have done a better job.   I used to rely on skype but now I find it unusable.	2018-10-11	1

Skype 8: Poor UI updates forcing people to app store	"The user interface resembles something from a drunken university midterm project and comes coupled with a way-too-regular and mandatory idiotic update mechanism which requires admin privileges (and is an obvious ruse to force people to ""Microsoft Store"").This piece of rubbish is, unfortunately, unusable.We are seeking alternatives to it now, well done Microsoft for being ""clever""."	2018-10-04	1
Well done MS	Well done MS, if your goal was to kill Skype utterly and completely you've done it with the flying colors. Replacing Skype classic version with that atrocity of the version 8 is a pure business suicide.Those incompetent nincompoops who are making shots over there should be given the medals for being the worst in what they do. And the guys who have nurtured and developed that monstrosity should be all lined up and mercy shot in the foreheads. Can work other way around as well.Seriously, the level of pure stupidity behind that company decision is beyond the comprehension of any sane person.Next time you decide to screw us over before purchasing and taking over another of our favorite programs, please for the love of God consider donating those billion of dollars to some good cause. There are so many sick and hungry kids and since you're already wasting your money at least try to do some good in this world.	2018-10-04	1
Absolute rubbish.	It was bad when Microsoft took it over, and they have systematically made it worse; RAM hungry and not at all user friendly. For example, the notifications no longer show on the task bar - they remain hidden unless the user interrogates.	2018-10-02	1

Truly Awful - Do Not Use	"I have tried to set up a Skype account and it is the worst customer experience I have had in a long time. I first try to do so using my mobile number, it says that this number is already registered to an account, which it isn't (as far as I'm aware). As a result I try signing in with the same number and it says ""account doesn't exist""!I try to remove my mobile number entirely form their records so I can ""start again"". However, it doesn't let you remove a number without signing in, which I can't do because I don't have an account!Next I try signing in with my email address (which is a personal domain) and again it doesn't let me because Skype only accepts Microsoft accounts.I try looking for a customer support number I can ring so I can try and remove my mobile number from their system/records. Apparently there isn't one, meaning that I can't create an account with my mobile number or email address.Terrible experience, I would like to think that this comment will be picked up and they can take the comments on board, however, given the fact I am one of 800+ negative reviews I highly doubt this."	2018-09-26	1
Skype has changed for the worse over…	Skype has changed for the worse over the years. I had a bunch of marked contact numbers in the old version of skype, which vanished with the new version, why oh why couldn't it carry those contacts over? Sometimes when I am on a call with someone , there is no history of the call being made after I close the call. I could see their number whilst on the call, and then it just disappeared.  The new version is terrible. Please bring back old skype and just leave it alone.	2018-09-26	1
Godawful	Godawful. Unusable now. Example: Someone calls, and you can't now automatically add number as a new contact. This should be a basic. Only option given is arranging a group chat.	2018-09-25	1
You've been in business for over a…	You've been in business for over a decade. Shouldn't the software work by now?  Frequent problems detecting and integrating with hardware, poor interface (why no intuitive resizing of video panels?). I'm recommending our business find an alternative to Skype for business.	2018-09-20	1
I don't know what it is	I don't know what it is, but every release of Skype over the last year has made the software worse. In the latest iteration, MS decided to give messages an orange background, severely lessening the readability because of reduced contrast.Only slightly less painful are the smilies that show up with EVERY message. You're in a serious or difficult conversation and the inappropriate smilie is there every message.And those are just the most excruciating issues. Get a grip MS.	2018-09-20	1
Skype has become totally stupidified	I have been using Skype for years, which has grown to become a cornerstone for my work. Skype 8 killed all of that with one well-aimed blow. Where to start? Essential features are still missing (advanced status control, multiple chat windows, adding phone numbers to contacts, compact view, searching within messages, etc). I find the user interface downright ugly, with bizarre colors and sounds, and is confusing to navigate. Hey, the interface does not even follow Microsoft's own guidelines for the equally ugly UWP system.  Last, Skype has gained stupid features such as highlights and stickers - STICKERS?! - in order to copy other chat tools.There are some positive new features, such as the media gallery, but this is only really needed if you somehow fail to organize downloaded data on your computer.Skype used to stand out for its sleek, simple, and elegant experience. Now it has been reduced to look like one of many, at the cost of essential functionality. Microsoft, what where you thinking?	2018-09-19	2

I used to love Skype but then Skype 8…	I used to love Skype but then Skype 8 came to the picture. I grew up with the Skype experience and it got deeply rooted in my day-to-day activities. However, with the newest version, the classic program got stripped out of its previous functionality, and the design got altered (to some extent better, to other - worse). Notifications are terrible, split view is not supported, it's supposed to run in the background but nothing indicates you are online. What a terrible app, now I am looking forward to the day when I will entirely stop using it.	2018-09-13	1
Had to reset my password for skype	Had to reset my password for skype.  Logged back in and....ALL my contacts disappeared. Completely ruined this once stable easy to use product. Well done Skype!

Good program when it started	Good program when it started but trying to up grade the sexed-up version for mobile is an absolute disaster.  they really should test the software before releasing it onto the unexpecting public!  With no option not to 'sync contacts' from my mobile, FOUR hours later it's still not completed - now I know I'm popular, but . . . !!!!!  They really have cocked this up!	2018-09-08	1
Good service	Good service	2018-09-07	5
From professional program to kids app	Skype used to the go-to program for any kind of professional communications. Unfortunately they decided to reposition Skype as a kids app (like MSN was back in the day).The new version is far inferior to the previous one in almost every way. It is slow, the UI is unintuitive and half the options seem to be missing. It even lacks basic functionality such as the ability to search your conversation.People need a reliable and robust program that allows for instant messaging, calls, video calls and screen sharing. Previous version fulfilled that need most of the time. The new version fails miserably.	2018-09-07	1
Microsoft, please give us Skype back!	"I used Skype for many years to communicate with my freelancers and clients. But Microsoft managed to incrementally destroy all the usefulness of this wonderful software. Bloated it with unnecessary frills and embarrassing colors the new interface is reacting slow and laggy. The service got extremely unreliable, not sending messages for hours.Recently i saw an old version of Skype running on a computer and felt this deep pain inside my heart, like you feel when you lost someone. I was not aware how painful it can be to loose a piece of software. Software i am using for hours each day.If by chance somebody from MS reads this message, i politely ask to remove all the ""design"" from Skype and make it a real, stalwart tool & service again. People are leaving Skype in droves, migrating to other services like slack because they just can not work with it anymore.If i would be MS i would rather have invested in the screen sharing experience (like adding a mouse pointer or some interactivity) than adding useless kitsch."	2018-09-07	1

It seems redesigned by a phone only…	"It seems redesigned by a phone only freaking addict to social texting.  Don't you know ""Windows"" made windows because of the ability to have several ""windows"" with different content at a time ?!!!I understand the new skype focuses on mobiles. But it at least give the chance to the user to configure if it wants the old multi windows style in the desktop application. Having multiple chats now, is ridiculous annoying. Before you can even have all the windows on screen. Now, back, find, forth, check, confuse, ... awful. And what happen with the ""Away"" status. So handy.  Of course, now they assume you keep your phone with you all the time. Well, guess what, I can not keep my desktop with me all the time! Since I am a developer it is connected to lot of stuff and It won't fit in a backpack."	2018-09-06	1

Don't use it	"Absolute garbage. Every time my iPhone receives an ""update"" it gets worse. Or it will improve and the buttons actually work until the next ""update.""

Another fine mess, Microsoft...	"Used to use it and it was fine for a free program. Didn't use it for a couple of years. Then Microsoft bought it... *gigantic sighing sound*Heard it was now full of ads and impaired functionality. I was informed or found out that my account had been hacked or something, nice going Microsoft. Their recovery process involved me having to specify the date that I first installed skype, to the month. I couldn't remember the year that I installed it - I hadn't used it for 2 - let alone the exact month. So even though I could name all my contacts by first and last name, and email, from memory, and obviously had access to the email address I signed up for skype with and was using it for this recovery process, they wouldn't let me back in. Because I couldn't remember the exact month I first installed it.""Oh yes, now I'm likely to sign up for another account on this competent application from this competent company"" — said no one ever."	2018-08-28	1
Utter rubbish	Utter rubbish. In fact I'm thinking much harsher words than that but feel it best not to use them here.	2018-08-28	1
Worst SKYPE version ever	"Unfortunately, zero points is not possible. SKYPE has been a staple communications and meeting application for many years, until the then labelled 'classic' version was force-replaced by something unusable. No parallel chat windows, no easy way to interact with multiple contacts, and an interface that seems to be designed as a throwback to Windows 3.1 days. How this has been rolled out and survived usability testing is beyond me, but unless this mistake is corrected, SKYPE will no longer be viable for business or personal use for me. Simple fails such as not being able to customise a view (e.g. ""online contacts"") to be persistent when switching to a conversation and back are so disruptive that I cannot recall any worse designed GUI for any software in many years."	2018-08-26	1
Microsoft, what a joke	These guys have so called 'tough' tech interviews to hire top of the top engineers. That's the add of it. The real thing is that they are all dump, stuck at the bottom of their own dumpiness, without being able to see anything out of their Plato's cave. Here is the prove: the new skype.P.S. They lost the embedded segment, the mobile segment, and soon they going to loose the PC segment, Their OS Is an over-bloated API collection that it can be fixed only by their AI machine learning, you know the one they pretend they have, the one which it could not fix the Word, which keep crashing after 30 years of 'spaghetti coding' ... he he he what a dark joke... he he he, I cannot stop ...:))  :)  :)  ...	2018-08-24	1

Microsoft does not care	This version of skype has zero customization, and the interface is ugly as sin.  This version also no longer allows for window conversations to pop out so you can only do one conversation at a time.  Honestly they are killing skype faster than they are fixing it.  This latest update is clearly a sign of a company that no longer cares about the quality of their program nor stability and usability.  Their just doing what they want and we have to scream as loud as we can at them to get them to listen.  If they had to only use their own products they would feel the same way we do, it would be hell in their offices.  I bet any of them use discord or some other app, so all in all I give this program as it is a 1 star rating.  Use skype classic if they do not threaten it's existence with a set expiry date again like whining children not getting their way.Before you try to change the program fix it and fix what is wrong then work on making it look how you want.  If you can't fix what you broke, then why bother?  Fix the contract list issues, fix the chat history issue, fix the lack of customization, fix the program and then make sure we are happy as well as YOU ARE.	2018-08-19	1
Latest Skype version (8.28 Win10) is…	Latest Skype version (8.28 Win10) is unbelievably bad. Can't believe Microsoft quality control is this bad. Why make program this important worse by each version? Many years ago Skype was working perfectly fine. Now contact state is unreliable, status message line is not shown, chat is sometimes broken, Skype does not remember contact list settings, etc... Ok, If you can get video chat working, then connection is satisfactory. Bu please, make Skype better!	2018-08-19	2

Now there is a global search which searchs through everything...I really don´t get it...Those are only 2 of the things which are really annoying me. I want the old version back.	2018-08-19	1
Skype used to be fine why did Microsoft broke it	I use Skype for work for more than 10 years .This new interface is impossible to use for me.i can't have a window per conversation anymore plus closing it kill the application instead of just minimizing as it used to.I can't afford security risk linked with downgrading to previous version so I'm actively looking for another solution.	2018-08-16	1

Skype used to be tele-contactable	"Skype used to be tele-contactable, helpful and easy to use. I think Microsoft is trying to kill it by making it as user-unfriendly and remote as possible. As a multiple stroke victim (7 in 18 months) with limited manual dexterity, typing on live chat is exhausting and difficult (made more so than necessary by the tiny window a customer has in which to explain his/her problem.  The message is clear:""GO AWAY, we're not really interested in your problems with our now-restricted service!"""	2018-08-14	1
I am sure that whoever is in charge of…	I am sure that whoever is in charge of Skype wants to drive all the users to some other product as successive updates have made this once great program almost unusable. All of the control has gone. All the user settings are gone. All the bells and whistles that made the program great are replaced by unfriendly unhelpful screens and a generally amateurish look and feel. Way to go Microsoft!	2018-08-14	1

Not Good	The Things missing I noticed was no ability to change font size and when you block someone temporarily, they disappear from your friends list and there is no way to get them back.If this is where skype is going, all it's users will be finding other platforms.It felt bad enough when BIG BROTHER bought Skype.Now they want to make it worse?	2018-08-13	1
Worst Skype version ever!	Microsoft, what are you doing? Those who launched this, don't use Skype, do they? It's a terrible version. It lacks possibility to customize it or set it up, and this on top of a very bad UI. Just few examples:- You don't go away automatically, when you are off (not even such status exists).- No more compact vs complete view. The pseudo compact view takes 1/3 of my screen + you need to click at least twice! to change the screen from one contact to another (as you need to go through the main list). - Chat notification is a complete mess. I could continue, but you got the point.Honestly, I'm giving this star, because I cannot write a review without it!	2018-08-13	1
this new update is like going back to…	this new update is like going back to 1995, totally unuseable, gave it 1 star as there are no negative stars	2018-08-13	1
I HATE THE NEW SKYPE. No way to add contacts or make calls.	Why have they messed around with Skype again! There is no way to add contacts to the new version,, no way to see how to make calls.  I HATE IT! What was wrong with the last version?????????	2018-08-12	1
Used to be a great app that worked…	Used to be a great app that worked perfectly, until Microsoft bought it out.Since then they 'improved it' by adding over zealous noise-cancelling which will cancel out the conversation if there is any background noise. They've added more features that no-one asked for or needed making the installer pointlessly bloated.Their support is terrible, as in non-existent. You can give feedback which is completely ignored. You can email them but they never reply.The latest update (the worst version ever) has an unnecessarily larger single all-encompassing GUI which now won't let you have more than one chat window open, or have a chat window AND your contacts viewable without expanding huge window open.Worse, if you try to install any previous version, it will claim it 'can't connect' - of course it can connect, but it's forcing you to 'update' to the new crappy 'limited use' version.If you're looking for a reliable Vid/Voice/Chat client compact minimalist GUI, it's definitely NOT Skype !!	2018-08-10	1
I am not sure why would you change…	I am not sure why would you change something which was absolutely amazing to absolutely crap! Skype's latest version is the worst version ever and I am saying this after having been using Skype on a daily basis since 2010!The only reason why they would make it worse is to push people to get the more premium paid version of it or they may be coming up with a new product and want people to jump on to that. If this is not improved soon, Skype will be history soon!	2018-08-09	1
Extraordinarily inefficient	Extraordinarily inefficient, badly run and unhelpful. Skype seems to have gone to the dogs since Microsoft got involved - they don't respond to any requests for help and they make it almost impossible for you to sign in and use their services conveniently, though they are of course only too happy to take your money.    Altogether appalling customer service - much like their parent company Microsoft who claimed to have lost all of my emails and who then spent over 45 hours on the phone with me trying to persuade me that yes they could restore them, but failed utterly.	2018-08-09	1
Unbelievably obnoxious and not…	"Unbelievably obnoxious and not personalized service. If you don't have a problems it works ok. However,  if for any reason you stuck,  technically or financially, you screwed. I had yearly subscription for unlimited calls. They suspected some fraud activities for whatever reason is. It took me 6 months and 4 hours of calls to remove the block of the account. Guess what, I requested to extend the subscription for 6 months that were paid for but unabled for use, they said NO. No explanation,  but ""unfortunately we won't extend and won't prorate"". Simple NO. Microsoft is obnoxious and ignorant empire, where customers worth nothing."	2018-08-08	1
There was an issue with my Skype…	There was an issue with my Skype account that prevented me from gaining access. This was not a fault on my part and after several emails and calls to try and sort out the situation, Skype were still unable to grant me access. Not only did I loose my network of contacts, many of which I will not be able to find again, but I also lost over £20 of credit to which Skype refused to reimburse tor transfer to my new account. Very poor!	2018-08-08	1

Unacceptable, but you can reinstall Skype 7	I have been using Skype for many years. Skype 8 is just awful. However, you can reinstall Skype 7 over the new version. If you do not have the old installer, search for SkypeFullSetup.exe or skype_7.40.0.104.exe and install that. Do not upgrade again. There's a short announcement for Microsoft on a Skype support forum that the 1 September 2018 deadline no longer applies.Why is it bad? Uses huge amounts of screen space;many features of Skype Classic are missing. You cannot use a headset and have it ring on the PC speakers.	2018-08-08	1
Dear God MS	"Dear God MS. What are you doing???Skype was a wonderful product until the last few years. The ""upgrades"" and ESPECIALLY the UI now is terrible. TERRIBLE. Why the hell don't you TEST with your loyal users BEFORE you send the product out? My whole company has used Skype for years and we almost live on the thing. But now.... we are all uniformly scrambling to find another system.You simply MUST let pro users be able to customize the UI. All the things people complain aout the new UI below are real and true. WHY WHY WHY do I have to be SUPER-CAREFUL now that I don't hit ""Enter"" or the message simply flies out to the recipient. CTRL-Enter should still be available. There are DOZENS more examples. Even the SOUNDS now are super-annoying.Please get back the Ver 7 functionality. Revert to the code that worked, PLEASE. I've used this product since the very beginning and it's a crying shame what you are doing to what was a perfectly wonderful program. I *will* change (and so will my entire company) if this does not get sorted. So, so so sad. Sigh."	2018-08-08	1
If I could give less than 1 star	If I could give less than 1 star, I would. Skype used to work, then Microsoft bought it, now it's one of the worst programs I've ever had the displeasure of using.

Skype 8 is a big pile of horse S**T	Skype 8 is a big pile of horse S**T. The UI is horrible and they have stripped off most of the customizable options. Reverting back to 7 until supported and if they don't fix this s*** will change the program with something else...	2018-08-07	1
Only Microsoft could take a product and call a downgrade an upgrade.	Only Microsoft could take a product and degrade it to such an abysmal level.Simple things, like the option to send a message using ctrl-enter instead of 'enter' have gone. Now if you want to send more than one paragraph in a message you have to remember that you cannot just hit 'enter'. Just how dim do you have to be to deprecate a very needed feature for many.The new version is inflexible with many configurable options gone. Why would anybody take away features?You can't even have chats in separate windows or control how your online presence is managed.Awful.	2018-08-07	1
Really bad new look	Really bad new look, no search option inside the chat, slow, confusing	2018-08-06	1
To be honest the new Skype Version 8.x…	"To be honest the new Skype Version 8.x is horrible it looks unclear and confusing. Before it was easy and instant to see which groups are active and actual, which users are online or away, text was easy to read for eyes. Now everything is overcomplex and filled with unnecessary text. Graphics and Colors and fonts are completely chaotic and disturbing while reading.It really seems the new microsoft era is: buying tech companies and distroy them. Same happened with ""Microsoft Phone aka Nokia"".How can you change a software in a way that i get so uggly and unpracticable that clients will not gonna use it anymore. It seems they hire outranged Google and Apple guys to make their application look modern and fancy but MS Managers are too incompetent to understand: if you hire bad people (even if they have 10 PhDs) they will completely distroy even stable working MS software. Secondly if you hire cheap fresh IT students and put them into work teams they will distroy your last working software aswell (see skype 8.X)!To the Management: How can you accept a dev. Team to change a major product in a way that is looses their entire userfriendly interface?If they are not doing a 180° turn around it seems to me its time to start alternative solutions. Im 99% sure most of the skype clients will agree on the fact MS is loosing a lot of skype users and activity if they are not able to get the 180° turn and change the software as it was at Version 7.X!"	2018-08-06	1

What I think is really bad though is how if you don't reply to a message now.. it says you still have that message.  Once you look at a message it should mark it as read.  My only guess is they have put on some REALLY bad designers and programmers.  Microsoft needs to remove the Skype add-on from hotmail too as it is 100% unwanted.	2018-08-03	1
Latest update is a total fail!	I've used Skype for years, with only minor problems here and there. Overall I would have rated it 4-5 stars until the latest update. I'm simply going to uninstall it now and use WhatsApp for video chats instead. When I make a call, the big picture (video) on my monitor is of myself - the small video image in the upper right corner is of the person I'm talking with (the opposite of how is used to be). Sometimes, the other person only sees my profile picture on their monitor (again, on the small video image on their computer), despite the fact that my video icon shows it's active. Sometimes, if I double click the image on my screen, the larger video will revert to that of the person with whom I'm speaking, as it used to be.The Skype icon no longer shows up on my taskbar when I'm not actively using the program. It took me days to find out how to get my contacts to display as they used to. I've never seen such a dramatic failure of an update!	2018-08-03	1

Update has ruined Skype	I installed the update and lasted a week before rolling back to v7. It's hardly usable, is cluttered, the do not disturb status is gone and you can't search within a conversation. Apparently older versions won't work after the 1st September, so good luck everyone!	2018-07-31	1

This update is utter garbage	I've used Skype for the past ~8 years and this new update is just god awful. Old skype used to show the names and statuses of people in group chats. Now it says that there are X participants, and I have to click on it to see who's even in the group, and even in that window, it doesn't show any status update for anyone who isn't online. I want to see that people are offline/away/busy, don't lump them all into a non-existant indicator. When group video chatting, it forces you to either pick one person to focus on, or have everyone 'optimized' to fit the window. If they aren't centered to their camera you just can't see them. Why cant I have the option to see EVERYONE's FULL CAMERA, even if it would be smaller. Why can't I adjust the size of the chat box when I'm in a call?  So many useful features from the old skype have been stripped away leaving this un-customizable, frustrating-to-use shell of an app. It's like skype felt threatened by Discord's increasing popularity, tried to rush out an update and completely dropped the ball.	2018-07-29	1
Time for a new rival to skype?	"Ok, I'm fed up with all the ""improvements"" that just make this more and more useless. Does anyone remember the first version of skype where things just worked, you could be offline or away at choosing, calls just worked, you knew when messages where delivered and it didn't take up the whole screen of a tabled to view things.Vote up if you want to join a group of people to write a rival piece of software"	2018-07-28	1
10+ years of using skype just ended.	"After more than 10 years of using Skype as the go-to communications platform I'm now forced to update to the dreaded ""new"" update since older versions will stop working.It has terrible design that lacks some of the most basic functions. Good job destroying one of the biggest and best communication platforms for no reason and making long-lasting users switch to alternatives."	2018-07-28	1
This update was a mistake	Interface got a lot worse. Worst thing is, you can't see if someone is online unless their skype window is active. Are they killing skype on purpose?	2018-07-28	1

terrible new update	"Imagine being told you're getting a brand new car that's gonna be better than your last, yet all you actually get is a bike without any pedals that's missing a wheel and has no handlebars. that's what  this new update is for skype.how can anybody in their right minds remove more features than they add and have the audacity to say ""yeah, this is an update"" in my experience, here's everything i've noticed wrong with this new skype:-way slower, whether you have a high end computer or just a laptop, your messages are gonna take 3 seconds to send before they show up in chat, you're not gonna see new messages pop up until they load for about 5 seconds, the entire interface is slow, clicking on things is laggy, it's just slow -an unacceptable amount of cut content. They removed so many options,  and added maybe 3 new useless things.i can no longer choose the font i wanna use, no longer adjust my notification settings, no longer send 3 min. video messages, no longer change my audio settings, no longer turn off emoji'sbut oh, it's okay, you can change skype to be black nowy'know, just as a reminder that there's now a much better application you could be using, discordso many things are just bad."	2018-07-24	1
Skype 8 to 7 same as Windows 8 to 7 . Dysaster!	From today I wil have to look for another application to keep contacts with my suppliers as this evrsion is for boys and girls, not for people that have to work on a PC handling multiple conversation at the same time. Pls revert back to version 7 until you find a solution and some mor eintelligent programmers to make it workable. This 8 version remembers me ... Windows 8 !	2018-07-24	1

A blatent downgrade.	"Absolutely awful. No longer going to be using Skype, even though I have been using it for years. I thought my friend was exaggerating when he told me how many customization options they'd gotten rid of. I'm particularly annoyed at the notification settings, where you either have ""everything on"" or ""everything off"". I can't work with message previews popping up in the bin and sounds constantly binging, but I don't see the tiny little number fade into existence at the very bottom of the Skype icon on my computer.The lack of messaging settings, audio settings, video settings, file download settings - it's frustrating being forced into a clear downgrade. I'm using a desktop PC because I want to be on a desktop PC, please stop trying to turn your program into a mobile application.I would be fine if they allowed us to continue using the classic version like they'd told us before. But apparently they rescinded that! Back to Discord I go."	2018-07-23	1
Latest update of skype in July 2018 is a disaster.	"Latest update of skype in July 2018 is a total disaster.  It was forced on my computer by the ..... at Microsoft and has replaced a reasonable version of skype with garbage.  It is not even worth 1 star.  Some idiot has decided that making most of the text grey is a great idea.  It's not as I can't see it clearly.  Try to get your heads around this you MS morons; ""if we can't see it properly, it really is not much good to us"".The idiots have also been making up ""themes"" as if this any use at all.  You can have faded blue, burnt yellow or something else I truly do not want.  Worst of all, the downgraded the software so the webcam is now a fuzzy mess, out of focus and pretty much less, yet for other applications my webcam is clear as a bell.  Thanks so much MS for destroying skype.  Before you got your filthy hands on it Skype was brilliant.  No danger of that any longer.Meantime, I will look around for something else and I advise everyone to now do the same.  Microsoft of course will ignore all criticism because they feel they don't need to take any notice of people who use their stuff.  Well things are changing fast MS.  Your market share is down to less than 8% and the time is coming when you will be replaced by something better.  Perhaps then and only then will skype be given a new lease of life when it removed from MS."	2018-07-23	1
Terrible	"I tried the new version of Skype several months ago, hated it and went back to the Classic version. Now I'm being forced to use the new version (from 1 September, but I've ""upgraded"" now). I still think it's terrible, but at least I've managed to regain camera control thanks to Manycam.com"	2018-07-23	1

I hate the newest update	"I hate the newest update - the controls are moved around (in some cases, hidden), making it harder to navigate, for no apparent reason; and the ability to call up a contact list has been eliminated, making it much more cumbersome for me to ... well, group-call the people on my list. Even a handy feature of call notification - that is a signal that your outgoing call is being processed has been eliminated ... so you don't know if it's going through or not. There's no easy way to see who all you have in a group call ... that is, who has answered and who not (and whom you might have to call again). One of the ""improvements"" is the ability to emoji somebody with an illustration of what you feel... what!? you're on the phone (or video) ... you can't just say it? Oh ... and the new skype can't do my special (foreign language) characters like the old one does ... What's more and worse -- evidently, the old, better skype is going to be eliminated, so you don't even have the ability to stay with it."	2018-07-22	1

Layout is so horrible	Layout is so horrible. Older one was much better. Prettier doesn't mean better.This was already gone through when you changed phone layout. Did you listen or do anything about it? No. Instead, you brought this horribleness to windows as well. What is the point of users reviews and opinions if you are not gonna listen them anyway? If your goal was to lose user and push me towards discord, then congratulations. You succeeded.	2018-07-21	1

Microsoft's ignorance	Micro$oft's ignorance, arrogance and greedy incompetence continues to mark them as one of the ugliest corporations on the planet. Their destruction of Skype is one of a long list of shameful self-serving and to-hell-with-the-user acts of vandalism. Like many, I feared this day when they first got their filthy hands on Skype, as their modus operandi, that they would rape it for profit at the expense of the community, was glaringly obvious from from the outset. I avoid all their products like the plague these days and suggest others do too. Boycott Micro$oft. PS: I just tried out Google Hangouts as an alternative to Skype: it's slightly different but it works for me very well now I have got used to it.	2018-07-18	1
New Skype suck	New Skype suck. First of all it is laggy, which classic skype was never. I cannot find keywords in conversations anymore using ctrl+f, which used to be a very useful feature. When you open pictures from skype the open over the whole screen so that you cannot see the conversation anymore. If you happen to close the window by mouse you also close skype. The design is also less appealing, not as easy seeing who is online etc. I cannot see one single betterment with this update. Very, very dissapointing.	2018-07-18	1
What on earth...	What on earth.... Stop. Just stop. The previous bad update was better than this Skype 8 bullcrap! What the hell is with the camera? My video feed has NEVER looked so awful! Please just give us classic Skype back. It's the only one that ever worked right. How can I keep in touch with my family and boyfriend if the one platform we all use doesn't work!?!??! Please don't do this. Please change it back. This is ridiculous!	2018-07-18	1
Promise me this.	I want Microsoft to promise me just one small thing.   Please do not consider buying an aircraft manufacturing company like Boeing or Airbus.  If you did then I would have to drive my car from the UK to Australia for my holidays instead of flying because all the aircraft would have crashed.	2018-07-17	1
The new Skype is useless	The new Skype is useless. Was asked to updated my classic Skype to a new version today and got a very different and completely useless version. First of all the window cannot be resized - so when sharing screen you see it so small that it is impossible to see anything. The video is portrait instead of landscape - and it cannot be changed. Not very useful if you use Skype for video conference with more than one person. Unfortunately, Microsoft has removed the classic Skype from the download page. :(	2018-07-17	1

What a shame	What a shame. Skype used to be one of the major pillars of the internet. Now Microsoft have made it look like the work of a 6 year old kid who has never used Skype before and just wanted to fill the screen with useless garbage while disabling most of the original Skype features. No tools, no camera settings no Skype sounds control, no full screen ,terrible messaging, etc. etc. RIP Skype.	2018-07-16	1

You cannot polish a poo	Once upon a time, there was an application called Skype, it was simple, clever, fast and reliable. It allowed people to chat with instant messaging and IP telephony for free and even when we wanted to call a landline it wasn't too expensive. Wakey Wakey, its 2018 now. Skype has 'improved' no end, IM's take hours to send, my Android mobile rings but my PC doesn't, even if I go to answer the call on the mobile, i cannot find the button to answer the call. You have remarkably managed to turn a shining beacon of software development into nothing more than a poo, yet you continue to 'polish' it. I'd go back and get the original code that you bought and start again.	2018-07-04	1
Absolutely terrible upgrade.	Absolutely terrible upgrade.We rely on Skype for day to day business, and I'm often left waiting 30 minutes to an hour for messages to send, the mobile and desktop versions clearly work at different rates, and a series of user-friendly features (like copy and pasting chunks of conversation) have been cancelled. It seriously affects our ability to operate and we are now looking at other software to channel our comms.How does a company release a product like this and hope to retain customers? And why has it taken this long to fix these extremely obvious issues? What a waste.	2018-07-04	1

They still owe me account money for phone left behind.... never was a problem in the first place...  So,  I started a new account, it worked once with my new password, then same problem, Microsoft logo pops up and says they want to do me a favor and require another layer of identification....  I only got to use my account once, then fell into the abyss, no reason on earth for this.  I give up on Skype, sorry to see it go.. Now to close the 2nd account...	2018-06-24	1

Skype is dead	Skype is dead. Thanks Microsoft for destroying the best videochat client in the world.	2018-06-15	1
Microsoft ruined Skype	literally ruined skype, every update seems to be make the service worse which is baffling seeing as its been rock bottom for so long now	2018-06-14	1
Skype was brilliant	Skype was brilliant, but with each update it gets worse and worse!! The latest update May/June 2018 is utter rubbish, stupid layout, big text as if we are children who cant read, and sooooo sloooow!! Also, slower than ever at startup. I reverted back and the older version is a lot better. Time someone else did a service to replace this thing! I would give it -1 star if I could.	2018-06-08	1
I am really disappointed by Skype's…	I am really disappointed by Skype's recent performance. the desktop version is not successfully compatible with the app version. Everything is messed up and it starts sharing sound on its own. The mute button doesn't work sometimes. If one person share screens once the other cant share it so we have to cut the call and reconnect. Skype really needs to fix-up	2018-06-07	1
The new version of Skype desktop is one…	The new version of Skype desktop is one of the worst software ever seen from Microsoft.Your contact lists made on your own are gone now you can see what Skype Microsoft wants youi to see.Android version is at the same level.. Microsoft is the best company in the world to chase customers away.I really do not get it. This was a very solid software, now is a very solid C***.Regards	2018-06-07	1
Relaunch?	Classic change for change sake and for the worse; presumably a new generation of developers or new management feel the need to make their personal mark on this product, but it seems rather odd that MS are allowing them to turn off so many customers.Alternatively Microsoft want to trash the old name so the whole service can be re-launched and re-branded as an exciting and innovative MS product.I can visualise the marketing people in presentation ecstasy as they choose the new name for something that actually functioned very well when many of them were still at school.	2018-06-04	1

2003's version of this was better than the actual one, no jokes.	"I am a skype user since Beta. And you know what? even beta version was better than this.crashes, audio bugs and/or crashes, even  OS crashes (although it might be as well the poorly coded windows 10), horrible lag (i have a 200Mbit internet connection) and i can go on forever.i suppose because the so called ""developers"" are just too focused on collecting your data instead of delivering what the software is supposed to do.TLDR: we are in 2018 and skype sucks worse than its 2003 version.enough said"	2018-05-17	1

If only you could give negative stars.	If only you could give negative stars.Skype doesn't have support chat - even though they pretend they do with a round-about of hyperlinks back to the same pages. Their products do not function as sold - no called ID function in Australia I very rarely review anything but I am compelled to help warn others away from this appalling product.	2018-05-16	1
Getting worse and worse	In the past couple of years, Skype has been upgrading and changing its look without any actual chat quality improvements. I am asked to create a new login, my picture was automatically taken from Gmail instead of using my old Skype photo etc. All these updates are making Skype worse and complicated. I am going to use a software that stays the same (unless there are MAJOR improvements) or I am going to look for another form of communication. Poor quality, Skype!	2018-05-15	1
No chance to use Classic Skype for Win10	"Classic Skype stopped working on May for multiple Win10 users including me and I was obliged to use Skype 8.  In 2 words - this version is unacceptable for work.  I have 50+ chats every day and new Search doesn't allow me to find needed chat. some chats cannot be searched at all (those with ""Name1, Name2""). Searching public directory when I just want to switch local chat is completely redundant.Dozens of missing features like Copying/quoting several messages, creating chats by multi-selecting participants of existing chat, no search inside chat, lags and crashes when searching messages history, no Ctrl+Enter sending, no hyperlinks in chat names, ... I can continue this list endlessly.Make Classic Skype work for Win 10 at least!"	2018-05-15	1
Wow, from bad to worse to terrible, Skypes continual durge	Skype has to be one of the only products that gets worse with 'upgrades', terribly heavy/slow app. I just purchased international calling whilst I am overseas to call people for work and the Caller ID function does not work. I then purchased a dedicated skype number and the caller ID still doesn't work - all my calls are showing up as private. I've essentially paid $40 for the ability to listen to peoples voicemail, as not many people answer private calls. Skype also, and i guess this became a policy because of their utterly useless service, do not provide refunds for this .Oh and to top it off their support is non exsistent - they clearly have no interest in helping customers and fob pepple off to FAQ's with loops of hyperlinks,.........If you are planing to use a service to call home whilst you a abroard for more than a few days I would check out VoiP providers speciailly voipstudio. I will never use skype again for calling - utterly useless....I can only assume theyre actually trying to be this bad intentionally because they couldn't do it by accident.	2018-05-15	1
New version is absolute rubbish	"New version is absolute rubbish. Why ""away"" status has been removed? And  how do I check if somebody is available?

Absolute rubbish App for iphone	Absolute rubbish App for iphone. Call quality is terrible and constantly drops. Promises to be a phone service i.e. you dial a local number but really it is using 4G / wifi data to a server in your country which then makes a Voip call overseas to a local / mobile number.Voxofon and Rebtel are far superior platforms with high call quality.Do not waste your money.Microsoft should be ashamed of this!	2018-05-10	1

Microsoft's Incompetent Management & Financial Use	For a number of years, like many, I used Skype when it was, well, just Skype! Microsoft bought it, and that was the beginning of the end! Things changed, and all for the worse. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Skype AKA Microsoft are doing this, to adult users:''You need a parent's permission.Based on your age, we need your parent's permission before you can use this account. Using a web browser, sign in to account.microsoft.com to get your parent's permission and come back to try again''.The heavy handed stupidity then means, as with me, the adult cannot access their account, even if they have money credit. So, one then has to open a Microsoft Account, simply to contact Microsoft, and then they either ask you to adopt the child, even though I am not a child, and in adopting and verifying, they ask for PAYMENT! Yes, the parent, guardian or simply the person trying to get their adult account back up and running, is supposed to give back details or CC card details, and pay 50 pence, just to allow the account to go back to how it was, before Microsoft's thug policing interfered! They only offer an alternative which is to put through an ID request, So, I sent them my driver's licence, scanned. Two weeks ago! All I got back was some impersonal, dim-wit Microsoft email, asking for the ID, again, as they claimed it was not attached! So, this was sent, I emailed from both private email and said awful, new Microsoft account and guess what? Nothing! So, here we are, almost three weeks down the line, and Microsoft doing what it does best, which is interfere and bully, and do nothing! PLUS they wanted money, up front, from an adult, as they accused me of being a minor. The thing is, they are doing this to all non Microsoft members of Skype, and it is so transparent, as they almost force you into creating a new account with them! This is nothing to do with the various adult platforms dealing with underage threats or misuse, this is Microsoft flexing it's bullying muscles again and if you don't play ball, they block accounts, and do not deal with issues! This is why I dumped my Windows PC five years ago, and celebrated being free of the Microsoft and Windows grip! So, maybe I dump Skype> Maybe we should all dump both?!	2018-04-30	1

We can see a massive decrease of functionality for some odd kind of  ""flat design"" fashion which is not only harder to navigate but also leaves a lot of screen space totally unused. Tons of settings and keyboard shortcuts disappeared without a trace. Quoting is horribly broken. Microsoft, please, replace your hipster ""designers"" with functionality-oriented developers. I am sticking with Skype 7 and looking out for an alternative IM."	2018-04-20	1

Vulnerability to Hackers is Ripe.	Great free connection to most people worldwide, however their vulnerability to hackers and viruses makes the program unusable unfortunately. The risk of having your own personal computer/mobile device being controlled through skype, by a hacker makes the user experience very much negative and has made me as a once regular user, no longer use the program.	2018-04-04	1

Can't sign in from facebook anymore, don't have a microsoft account, built a new email to sign in because apparently my .edu email address won't work.  And then it required cell phone confirmation, and I don't have a cell phone, which is why I use Skype in the first place.Didn't see any warning about the new login system, now have Skype credit trapped in an account I can't access, which is just awful.After making several hours a week of Skype calls for almost eleven years, I'm finding a new platform.	2018-03-26	1
King Midas in reverse	"Never used it much, so it came as a surprise that it was such crap when I did several months after the ""upgrade""...  Wait, I'm not really surprised, in fact.

FRAUDULENTLY SOLD A NUMBER THEY DIDN'T OWN.	BEWARE HAVE BEEN  DEFRAUDED BY SKYPE.I purchased a Skypein number for £41.48 in 2016, and have bought cards with it on, and given it to everyone I know. I renewed the subscription in 2017 and have forwarded it to my mobile and paid skype £10 for skype credit. When I tried to call my own number it goes to another company! I rang the company and the guy explained me bought the same number from Skype 10 years ago, and ported it away from Skype 3-4 years ago as they were so useless. So, I go back to Skype to explain that they have charged me for something they did not even own, and am getting the run around by the utterly useless offshore support clowns. I have just been robbed of £92 for something I never received, they never had to sell, never worked, and now I am having to fight them to get my money back.	2018-03-01	1

Skype is stealing money intentionally from its clients	Since Skype is taken over by Microsoft, Skype App became pathetic.But the major problem is that Microsoft is over billing the Skype customers secretly which I can now call intentional FRAUD. This does not happen just one time but many times. For example they continue to bill the cancelled subscription. When I started a chat they denied that subscription was cancelled and I had no proof because I never expected Skype to cheat me so I did not took the screenshot and it never emailed me any cancellation email so I asked the chat agent to now cancel it and write it down so that I have a proof by taking the screenshot of chat and he confirmed that now he has cancelled and it will not bill again but on next due date it got billed again and I contacted them again and they just gave lame excuses and still did not refund the extra billed money and said that due to some technical issue it was billed again. But technical issue was not my fault. It was set for 3 months billing and I can't keep checking every three months if they bill my card secretly or not as I make many purchases with my card. And it is not an excuse to bill me so much more for their system issues. I told them it was cheating and they just said that they can only apologize and refund is not in their control due to system problem.I have a many numbers purchased from Skype and I can not get rid of it now because those numbers are already given to many clients of ours. We have a Skype Manager account which was promised to get a priority support. But since Microsoft took over, it became a nightmare. Same thing happen again for a yearly number purchase and I got really angry and told them that they must refund the money because number was failed to be registered by their system and they still secretly billed my card so they said that they will refund it because I threaten to go public this time. The chat agent said the amount is refunded in Skype account but when I checked few dollars balance that was in Skype Credit was also gone instead getting my $30.00 back in Skype. So I told the chat agent that you guys are trying to make me fool but he said that he refunded it to my card and all amount will show on my card in few days. It is two months now but amount never showed in my card and if I am going to call them again they will give same lame excuses that not sure what happened. If I go for chargeback, they can cancel my remaining numbers giving the reason of the dispute. So now Skype is basically fraud and black mailer also. I have started a chat more than 20 minutes ago and still it is showing following wait message and I invest so much time in the issues that were already discussed and promised to be resolved after investing a lot of my time and effort:==We are experiencing higher than normal wait times. Thanks for your patience. You're still in line for chat.==This is 100% genuine review. Skype case number is 1407531109 New clients avoid Skype's paid subscription and existing clients slowly move paid services away to some decent and honest company.	2018-02-17	1

If I could give a 0 that is how I would …	"If I could give a 0 that is how I would rate the newest version of Skype/microsoft.  I am at a lost to understand how such a terrific company could deteriorate so quickly.  Let me say, I spent a good 6 hours trying to tackle the issues, one by one using the absurd ""customer support"" which is non - existent and expects the ""community"" to give answers.  This is just blatant irresponsibility.  Put PEOPLE back in the equation.  Frankly, goodby e Skype."	2018-02-09	1
Worst piece of junk software ever	For applications that have stooped so far down to the bottom, there should be an option to give ZERO or NEGATIVE stars. Where to begin with this piece of absolute junk. Everything in it, has problems. You can't even copy text rom the chat and paste it correctly. The chat window is too small and you cannot resize it, when you have the call view open. It misscalls contact, if you are typing on one chat and a incoming call occurs, the next key that you tap, will answer the call, weher you like it or not. There's no configuration options. The only thing missing from the latest release would be an even uglier UI design and some kind of heavy adware. This would make it the perfect all time candidate on how not to do software. The notifications sounds do not work. The sound quality and general call quality, which ought to be the CORE and MOST IMPORTANT feature are the same or worse. And many others issues that I just cannot be bothered to write. What was so wrong ith the previous version Microsoft, that could not be fixed?And, if you had to make it all from scratch, which is fine if done right, why would you choose to release such a mediocre product, long before it is even as good as the previous version? Why?	2018-02-05	1

Refusal to issue credit refund	I just found out that skype will only refund credits bought within 14 days of purchase. Is this legal? In California gift cards purchased (basically advance credit) can't legally expire, so how does skype get away with keeping money you paid them for credit which hasn't been used? Regarding another issue, in attempting to reach a skype representative through their online chat feature, I waited for over 50 minutes as I was informed there was heavy volume, but I was still in line to reach an agent. When an agent finally came online, I was told they could not help me because a system update was in progress. Anybody who knows anything about computer systems realizes they could have generated a message explaining that the system update was in progress and for customers to try again later, but, instead, their failure to implement a simple solution kept dozens of customers waiting, collectively, for hours. What's worse is that in chatting with a supervisor the next day, he didn't know enough to realize this and dismissed my suggestion, saying I didn't understand their system. Terrible customer service!	2018-01-22	1
DISASTER:  After using Skype since Day 1	"After using Skype since Day 1, I will be forced to leave the service - after having been a paying subscription business user.  At least on my laptop version [the latest], there is no ""menu bar"" and no sign whatsoever of basic features like setting voicemail, checking connection speed - much less proactive blocking of users nor being able to sue the dialpad during calls - essential for long distance teleprompts.  Instead, this is essentially a TOY and the customer ""support"" is simply classic Microsoft arrogance."	2018-01-18	1
Micro Soft ruined Skype	In all fairness, I am not a fan of Microsoft, so my review may be somewhat slanted. True to their modus operendi, Microsoft screwed up Skype. Skyoe used to be a very intuitive application to use. Since MS took over, it is more complicated and a mess in the sense that it simply doens't work. Microsoft- get your stuff together. Then again, I don't carewhat MS does- I will no longer be using Skype.	2018-01-16	1

What happened	"What happened? Suddenly calls keep dropping. I can't have multiple chat windows open. The window on my desktop takes up half the screen for no particular reason. When a call is coming in, the ringtone comes out of my desktop speakers even though the audio is set for the headset.  And that's on the PC. I'm guessing that my voice calls will continue to be put on perpetual hold on the iphone every time an alarm goes off. I have been a paying customer for years. Now contemplating the annoying project of finding a replacement that gives me back seamless service delivery. Luckily I am still able to download ""classic skype"" - wonder how long this will last! On the last Win10 update, it automatically replaced ""classic skype"" with ""newCrapSkype"" and I had to go find the download again at skype.com /get-skype"	2018-01-10	1

I have always hated Microsoft and now I hate them even more	WORST UPDATE EVER........I have used Skype for over 15 years for business communication and overseas voip telephony, but since Microsoft took over they have absolutely killed everything. Why on earth anyone would think it was a good idea to remove all the existing critical functionality and replace it with childish gimmicks like a colourful interface is beyond me. I can't even access the contact list on my mobile phone anymore. Instead have to search for the contact, then copy and paste the phone number over to Skype application to make a call. It's a fricken voip telephone service...what possessed you to unlink the contact list?? Seriously?? No words!! I never take the time to write reviews, but I guess I'm really hoping someone at Microsoft is listening. To put it as nicely as possible, you've basically taken a perfectly good, feature rich product and turned it into a colourful featureless piece of rubbish (I wanted to use a much harsher four letter word). Good work!!!	2017-12-08	1
Horrible new update - Skype ruins business customers	this is impossible. It used to be a tool for business calls and chats. Now it looks like Facebook chat. Makes me sick.

I would give 0 stars if I could	"I would give 0 stars if I could. I was a Skype user for more than 10 years, until I was locked out of my account, simply because I got a new laptop and my old one was dead, so I couldn't access the account through that.  I had not forgotten my password, but didn't have access to the old email I had used when I originally signed up. I was send through an incredibly cumbersome verification process, asking for information from when I first signed up, as I said more than 10 years ago.  I provided credit card and payment info that  was correct and my security word.  I did this on my own at least 3 times and was denied access every time.   I finally chatted with someone from the support team for almost 1.5 hours and it was an absolutely horrible experience and complete waste of my time.  I was asked to do the same thing over and over again to recover my account, even though I explained from the start that I had tried that multiple times.  It never worked and the guy didn't try to find any other way of solving the issue, just saying it can't be done.  I have a balance on the account and he would not even give me a refund.  My money is basically being stolen.  The account recovery process is completely ridiculous, asking for information from more than 10 years ago and security words being ""not enough"". According the to the guy I chatted with, there is no way to send me a recovery link, besides through that process.  It's hard to believe a technology company has no real way to troubleshoot a technical problem.  Skype obviously doesn't care about a customer who had used the service for more than 10 years and paid hundreds of dollars in that period. This is completely unacceptable."	2017-11-17	1

I am able to input my Skype username and my password (which takes 2 attempts with the correct password...the first attempt never works). I then get another page which says to enter my MS account. Then says.......outlook dot ie isn't in our system. Make sure you typed your email address correctly. It usually looks like outlook.dot comMy account IS the .ie. I DO NOT have a .com account.I was asked a couple of times to do a verification thing to make sure it was, in fact, me, with a whole load (it went on and on) of stupid questions. Some could only be answered if I was logged in!! The stupidity of them (Skype).Why do they need this if I have my password and my username? Why not just a simple code to my mobile phone?Their agents are totally inept. They took over my computer 4 times and I had to stop them One guy was where he should not have been...on my desktop and hovering over my folder shortcuts!! He actually clicked on one......can you believe?I have spent hours and hours with these useless guys and got nowhere.Yes. I uninstalled maybe 6 times, cleared the cache, etc etc. All to no avail.Funny thing...the App works fine on my Samsung.MS has made a right mess out of Skype and I am looking now for another VOIP provider. I don't need Skype anymore.Good riddence.AVOID at all costs for paid calls.	2017-10-31	1

Terrible customer service with no actual resolution.	I called customer support to rectify a situation where I've had two existing subscriptions. A 1 month and a 3 month... these should not even co-exist and I don't know how they both existed. Lag time between canceling, switching or somehow they both were created at the same exact time. I usually get 3-4 e-mail confirmations about the same transaction from my e-mail and phone about the transaction so it's easily dismiss-able to WHICH transaction is being taken place.I contacted the customer service, not only where they condescending, they make it entirely your fault despite admitting for having a faulty system at that time and stating that it no longer does that now. I have screenshots of the conversation as it won't let me have a transcript, possibly from the terrible customer service they provide.I asked for a refund and told them that there was a greater issue than just bandaging the current issue at hand. I asked him to cancel all my subscriptions and it became apparently hostile. After I received the cancellation confirmation and told him so, he immediately disconnected, completely unprofessional.If this individual couldn't handle my case or issue, I should have been sent to someone that could either come to a better resolution instead of hanging up immediately. Absolutely terrible.	2017-10-06	1

My solid old iphone 4s (usable in all …	My solid old iphone 4s (usable in all respects prior to this upgrade) can no longer use Skype. Skype is a messaging platform and there is no reason why a phone such as this cannot run a simple messaging program. Microsoft have simply decided to make a new app and then restrict access to older versions. Have tried the 'zany' new social media makeover on another Android phone and it makes the application rather horrible to use for a traditional user that simply wants to transfer a message. In addition, the installation of the new app turned my status to online, whereas it has always been set to 'invisible' - I am not impressed.  I have decided to transfer my usage to whatsapp, all my phones, desktops, the lot, my whole family. Surprised and annoyed.	2017-09-08	1
Kept calling same number	Opened up window to call a number and typed the number in and dialled it and call went ok. Then deleted number in the box to call a new number. Skype called the old number again. Found out that this is some crazy feature Skype added which is not user friendly and annoying. Instead they tell you to 'close the call window and open it again for every call you want to make'. Sorry Skype you just lost a customer out of embarrassment due to calling someone over and over when another number was displayed. Do your developers actually test their product on simple casual users or are they out to make the skype experience as frustrating as possible nowadays?	2017-09-08	1

Also valrious PCs (Win 7 and 10) and Mac. Interface is different on each device.  It is hard to explain to older people (my parrents) every time Skype team makes change to interface and they have no clue where to find contacts anymore but Skype offers them tons of different things that are completely useless for most of the people.  I'm done with that  crap. There are better alternatives.  At least Hangouts looks same on all systems including Windows PCs, Macs, tablets and phones.	2017-08-27	1
The average User Experience with Skype	When MSN Messenger was no longer an option, Skype was the best alternative. Since that point, the company really have become far too full of themselves. Bugs are plenty and updates to fix them are few. There are far more issues to condemn Skype than there are to praise it.Here are some frequent issues:1. Pending / Undelivered Text You can be typing away without issue when suddenly your messages are met with a spinning circle pending connection. At this moment, it's common to check if your internet is experiencing issues or perhaps the fault is with your partner (Whomever you're typing to). Commonly, I will send a message to someone else at this point to discover if the fault is on my end or on the other users end. Most, if not all times, I am met with the same issue, that messages sent to anyone from me are pending. I then decide to check my browser and load up websites or videos to ensure I am receiving a connection. The connection is fine, everything else works as intended apart from Skype. This typically lasts anywhere from 1 minute to 5 before the messages will all suddenly send at once.2. Accidental CallsIf you accidentally hit the keys Ctrl+Q, you have hit the short keys to initiate a call within Skype. Typically, this happens when the user has accidentally hit Ctrl rather than Shift. Now, if you call someone and did not mean to, the easiest thing to do is press the cancel call button before the other person answers. However, after having tested this specifically 10 times in a row, both my skype program and the other users skype that receives the call, crashes and stops responding. I tested this multiple times and without fail, every single test, it had the same result of both participants skype not responding.3. Skype on Mobile Skype on mobile is simply not a viable option whatsoever. Regardless of how powerful the hardware your phone sports, Skype will inevitably hit a stand-still and is required to be shut down and reloaded. It starts out fine, being able to type at any speed you're capable of. However, as typing goes on, the keyboard begins to lag and suddenly you're having to slow yourself down to pressing individual letters slowly and steadily while the on-screen keyboard has a chance to catch up.At this point, to prevent it getting worse, you are required to close the app and re-open to refresh. This happens without fail on a regular basis.Conclusion: Skype has many issues that require immediate attention, yet regardless of how many complaints are put online and how many issues are voted highly in the realms of needing fixed, Skype falls silent. We have updates that change the appearance and interface of Skype, giving it a new look and feel, however the same issues from the past persist. If skype wishes to compete with other upcoming services, they really need to begin listening to their user base and not shunning them.Review date: 26th August 2017 Skype version: 7.39.0.102 (most up to date version at the time of this review)	2017-08-26	1

If I log on with username, it seems to be an entirely different account, and nothing works.2) It is very difficult to find the links for live help. FAQs don't help much. On the other hand, once you're in a chat with tech help, things go pretty smoothly.3) When you pay for a service, Skype automatically makes it a recurring charge. This is nakedly profit seeking, and should not happen. I'm quite capable of deciding if I want to continue the service or not, thank you.4) The add credit thing is confusing. I wasn't seeing my subscription show up (see issue #1), so I added credit. I hope I can apply that to my subscription rate over the next couple months. Unfortunately, there are a lot of horror stories online about that, so I guess we'll see.	2017-07-28	3

used to be good now it's clunky …	used to be good now it's clunky compared to competition	2017-07-26	3
Updates and fixes, but without the fixes.	My Skype experience as a user has been very clunky, and ever since I used it on Windows 10 I encountered numerous problems. The most common one would be the calls randomly dropping out and video calls sometimes freezing. But the worst part about this is that it keeps pestering you with updates. I've been suckered into updating this software on a regular basis, and I always do it in hope that it may remedy the problems I had earlier, but instead nothing's been fixed. In fact I'd say the updates made it worse. Now my video camera won't even respond. It tells me to close down other programs that may be using it (even if Skype is the only program that's cocking open), and the call dropouts are just as annoying as ever.There's no reason for all these updates if they can't even fix the most basic of problems. A Shambles.	2017-07-24	1
Good job microsoft	Good job microsoft, where do I start with these blatant morons? Microsoft give all the companies back their shares or fund them but have NOTHING to do with the development of them you have constantly proved time and time again you are a piece of crap company i'll give you a comparison.Before microsoft stuck their crap fingers into skype.Dropped out rarelygood alternative from msnworked with long callsAfter microsoft.Constantly and randomly drops callquality of video and audio that is unstableCalls bug out of some people for no reasonmy skype stops responding randomlyfor some reason the responding problem disappears if I use the new horrible windows 10 skype (STOP FORCING PEOPLE INTO YOUR SHI**** UPDATES)phone skype is 100 time worse with so many options removed and a snapchat ripoff.If you value any sanity steer clear of skype and use something else until microsoft does us all the favor and leaves.Why change so much skype? for no reason everything was perfect and then you add all these stupid features to play around with? with no options just this is the new update if you don't update you'll suffer so update and then suffer with our ridiculous changes. . . LOOK AT GOOGLE REVIEWS!!!! on phone devices guys stuff the positive ones look how many negatives are all commenting about skypes recent update.	2017-07-24	1
I have used Skype for a few years and …	I have used Skype for a few years and had no major problem until recently.The latest update seems to have made a complete mess of what was a good service. It cuts outs out more than ever, its not clear anymore and the other party cannot see me on there screen. I have tried every possible setting to sort this but to no avail. As my children live a long way from me I rely on this service to keep in contact. Unless this is sorted ill not be renewing my sub with them because of the above.	2017-07-21	1

Since more than 10 years, I was a convinced skype customer, using them daily and paying them monthly !Yesterday, suddenly my external skype dualphone RTX 4088 stopped working. No calls, no agenda, no nothing.Then I found out that Skype stopped supporting this kind of phones !What ? Why didn't they advise ??Today I had a live chat with them and they just said : our refund policy does not allow us to refund you the 36€ or credit. Bye bye.**** Sorry, but this is absolutely inacceptable !!!!Microsoft everyday is worse !I will not spend my future money on this company !	2017-07-12	1
One of Microsoft's many big mistakes	One of Microsoft's many big mistakes. Yet again trying to catch up with a trend they did not initiate (in this case, youthful social networking) and by doing so, alienating their serious user base (people who just want to call someone on video or phone, not throw emojis or add silly drawings to pics). Incidentally, horrible design and graphics.	2017-07-12	1

Does not have any support	"Does not have any support, except the ""community"", even when you are on paid contracts with them. Plus the support site is very slow and often does not work. My voicemail is broken and have not been able to fix it, nor find anyone at Skype who is able to help."	2017-06-26	1
WWW - Worthless Worldwide Waste of your time (and money)	Was great oncee but as mentioned by other reviews around the web, since bought by Microsoft went down rapidly, the amount of adds thrown into anyones bandwith is a noisance, particularly at places where you pay for data volume or with poor internet connection. I wasted my time signing up for their 'Worldwide Unlimited'  calls plan trial. Thanks heavens I went for a trial or I would have wasted my money on a NON-REFUNDABLE worthless plan. I have had it running for 2 days and not a single call completed. Any number gets disconnected as soon it is dialed. Not an internet connection issue, as I can reach the same number immediately after by using another VOIP provider. Worldwide Worthless plan, stay away.	2017-06-16	1
An insult to r-tards everywhere.	What happened to Skype during recent times? Did the sane ones die off? It used to be good and in the last year or so it's gone completely downhill.To summarize: Cut outs in call quality. Absolute ZERO customer service. And worst of all - after an update my mic stopped working properly (both internal and various plug-in devices) and I tried every way to fix it - there is also no way of rolling back and using an older working version of Skype.To make matters worse. Skype web doesn't even work with Firefox browser.I can only say that Microsoft's days must be numbered if this is the way they are heading. To call this companies policies and actions of the last year r-tarded would be an insult to r-tards everywhere.	2017-05-31	1

No customer support on Skype	No customer support on Skype. I can't access any email or phone support to get back into my account when I'm locked out - the on-screen and email prompts tell me I need to log in before I can access support. How unhelpful is that!So I can't use the credit I've paid them, and can't find any way to keep using Skype, unless I create a new account, which is a hassle since I have quite a few contacts who know my Skype address.No good at all. Nil points.	2017-05-16	1

Horrible customer service	Horrible customer service, no phone number, no options for when you're locked out of your account. Customer service requires you to login to contact them, MY PROBLEM IS THAT I'M LOCKED OUT. Would not repeat.	2017-05-03	1
Amazing for calling on WiFi	Amazing for calling on WiFi. I always use Skype to call to my friends when we'd like to game. I've never bought a credit to call someone, guess I'll use my phone, much cheaper and better, in my eyes credits on Skype are useless. Anyway, you should definitelly use it :).	2017-04-29	5
Skype will take your credits!	Skype will take your credits!If you are inactive for more than 180 days Skype/Microsoft will inactivate the credits on your account. Activating the account again is almost impossible - you have to remember amounts and dates of historic payments, which is impossible after more than 180 days. It is an unacceptable practice. Recommend to only use the free parts of skype.	2017-04-17	1
I paid 240dkk for a year subscription but it does not work	Skype was kind enough to take my mone when I purchased a yearly subscription, but they forgot to give me my product. I cannot call via Skype and there is no Skype support line anywhere where I can get hold of a person who could help. Very frustrating.If Skype is reading this please contact me ASAP. 29/3 update. I have raized the score. I finally got the credit I paid for, and it now seems to work as I wanted it. However I still find it hard to get a real picture over my subscribtions and when they are valid from/to.Filip	2017-03-15	4
What is there now is not Skype	I have used Skype for years. It was a wonderful service and solved so many problems for me.  What is there now is not Skype.  It does not deserve the name. Its disappearing makes me sad.  It was a good thing.What is there now is some version of a non communication nightmare that has no real customer service but rather endless loops. It is possible that you will be charged for something you do not want to be charged for. It is unlikely you will be able to file the form to get it back. You will want to close your account. You will become bewildered about how to do so. You will  try and try to follow the loop to customer support, be forced to join Microsoft something or other while so doing.  That will not help you. You will be switched back and forth across web and non-web Skype and into microsoft verification forms endlessly. I largely feel neutral about Bill Gates and how he has earned his fortune and then gives from it.  I did admire the giving piece.   This fake Skype changed that for me. His affiliation with this product, bewilders me.  It is truly terrible now and feels like it steals from people by how it charges and evades - recourse.  He would do well to discontinue his affiliation with it soon before it really damages his reputation.	2017-03-02	1

Corp practices taking down a once great company	I use skype often for work/personal use and it is a great service. Also was an investor in Microsoft. Occasionally I use it to call/text mobile numbers, but not every 180 days and here lies the problem. The credit expires. Isn't that nice for your balance sheet and horrible for the customer? I have to go through an activation hoop, if I have time/notice that my 3.22 cents is expiring within another 180 days. You are burdening happy customers with mindless games to save transfer balances from customers to your balance sheet. How about entrusting your product team to create features that people will happily pay for instead of features that finance/senior management want to show shareholders quick wins. Devesting in Microsoft. Wrong approach :)	2017-02-08	2
Using by inertia	The quality of service went down a bit. The call sometimes may hang just with no reason - thats the most frequent. But I gathered a huge contact list over these years, so will be using it till the end, maybe the service gets better.	2017-02-01	3

As far as I am concerned skype credit is added in emergenices becasue you need to ring abroad. I am now just waiting. Please activate the money that I added so that I can actually use your service.4 hours Later and still no credit or response from Skype. Well done skype, you really helped me in my difficult situation. What is the point of you if not for ringing abroad in and emergency? What else would I need credit for? If you don't provide the service, why offer it?	2017-01-03	1

When enough is enough	When will Microsoft estimate that they earned enough money and that they can start doing thing for the users and not for them to earn more money?Microsoft bought Skype (by the way I hate the guys that sold that company to Microsoft. you had a pearl and gave it to the devil, shame on you). and since then my Skype is just annoying me more and more day after day. The problem is that I was one of the first users of this program around me nobody used it that I was telling every one about it.. now I just feel a shame to have participated to the extension of this program.So Skype since Microsoft:- obligatory update.-big load on my computer but also modem usage.- discontinuity of compatibility with the skype mobile I bought for a lot of money.- discontinuity of service to the fixe phone I also bought a lot and for all family.- discontinuity of service with Samsung new TV I bought just for that...- and now the latest, Skype make commercial with sound so suddenly out of the blue in the background of my computer a voice comes and scare the s...t out of me. I thought my grand ma was crazy when she told me that she heard sound coming from her computer... but then I understood. and till now I have found no way to deactivate that except just closing sounds completely for Skype... I am sure that you have a longer list and have other issues with skype since Microsoft took it over. for example cut of services all day or weeks in certain country (never seen before Microsoft took over) ...Anyway, Bill don't you think you have enough money? is it not time to give back to the users without trying to F..k us with backdoors and I don't know what.	2016-12-15	1
The whole software is crap	The software is terrible, since microsoft took over skype, it just went down hill and laggy software.	2016-12-06	2
Confusing interface - poor quality	IMO - the whole Skype & S4B platform falls very short of a valid business solution. Microsoft have spent billions developing this product suite for it to be entirely lacklustre.Even the remote app is a pain to use, it doesnt do some UI niceties such as carriage return when sending an IM. The system is slow and integration with Outlook extremely poor.As a comparison, the good ole fashion MSN Messenger was a far better and more simplistic package.If we now compare any of the Skype editions to a modern competitor such as WhatsApp - it's way behind the times with integration, speed and device support.Come on Microsoft - SORT IT OUT!!!!	2016-11-21	1

Next thing get 2 debits of £100 on my credit to a Skype account that's not mine.Impossible to contact Skype for reasons above and have to go though the rigmarole of cancelling credit card.Opened another Skype account but would never put money on (gave up trying to get balance on my hacked account ) and would advise all against giving them cc details.

Skype is a scam	"My old Skype account was compromised and money taken from my account.  Skype ""customer support"" ask you to fill out a verification form.  I filled out this form 3 times and they said each time that I did not fill it out correctly so they can't discuss this any further.  I copied the information directly from the logged in account, so I can only believe that this is deliberate so that they don't have to support you.  Not supporting you means that they can keep your money.  The timing of the hack is especially suspicious as it happened straight after I reactivated some old credit on the account.  I firmly believe that the attitude among their support staff is to deny support.  The biggest worry though is that since they are owned by Microsoft now, any credit cards you have on file with Microsoft Live for other services are SHARED with Skype.  So they will continue to defraud.  I've given them plenty of opportunity to resolve this, even tweeting them.  They even said their supervisor would contact me but nothing.  They have no interest because their whole support system is corrupt."	2016-10-19	1

Too resource heavy.	After the birth of Discord, I have stopped using Skype entirely. Anything Microsoft touches turns to complete BS. Skype is laggy, and slows down your computer. Phone calls often break up, and chat messages takes long periods of time to send at times. I recommend using discord. It's fast and less resource heavy.	2016-08-16	2
Account Hacked and lack of support from Skype unreal ... It's a Groundhog Day experience	So my Skype account is hacked which is upsetting, worrying and scary.You want a quick resolution to this to put your mind at rest.But the Microsoft owned Skype add fuel to the flames of worry but making it almost impossible to contact them.When you do you need to complete a form so detailed and asking for information that many would never remember that the experience is like Groundhog Day or deja vu all over again.Not surprisingly this leads nowhere other than repeating the same proces time and time again ergo reference to Groundhog Day.In complete and utter desperation I wanted to cancel my Skype account which is a hard as quitting LinkedIn who are also now owned by Microsoft.I actually think that you should be able to buy an anti-Microsoft Virus Software for ALL Microsoft Companies, as once you allow this behemoth onto your PC, Tablet it's harder to get rid of than Japanese knotweed.The irony of this situation, given its VOIP, is that it's impossible to call them which would make life easier and remove the on-going stress Skype causes in these situations.In such a litigious age maybe if someone took legal action against them for the resultant stress they cause it might set a precedent for others!Truly awful experience and 8 months still unresolved.	2016-07-06	1
A nightmare to cancel my charges for using Skype	"I used ""Skype"" to talk to a friend in America a few months ago. And although it was so very easy to set up payments from my Bank account to use ""Skype"", it was a different story when I wanted to end my contract.It took so many phone calls And emails to ""Skype"" to cancel my payments. I must have wore out the buttons on my phone.I spoke to so many different operators on the phone. (It nearly drove me ""Mad"" & I shed a few tears with frustration.)They couldn't find my user name or my account number, & all sorts of problems. Eventually I found a rep of there's who helped me, & I was just so relieved to be free from them. NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE SKYPE"	2016-07-04	1

Great but sucks	Skype is great for use, but if you want to delete your account, it is the worst kind of way out!!! The site is not updated, because they mention an email adress for contact so they can delete your profile, but it is almost impossible to find it! All in all, if you create a skype profile, be sure that you want to keep it, because it is a hell of a puzzle to delete it.	2016-04-01	2

Skype 2015: Dodgy practices and shocking customer service	I have once visited Korea and used my usual Skype account from there. Interestingly, according to Skype, I'm now forever based in Korea and my account is linked to some weird Korean provider making it difficult to perform the simplest transaction. Skype's customer service, unhelpful and arrogant to say the least, was trying to convince me that I set up my account with their Korean partner. It didn't matter that my account was set up years ago before they even entered into the partnership. The individual I was speaking with, didn't even bother to check these details, instead I was requested to verify my address by sending them a bank statement/ bill (?!?!) Once document received, the process on their end would take min 24-48 hours. Of course, she was deaf to me saying that I urgently need to purchase the service, I'm not based in Korea, I don't even speak Korean and I only holidayed there for 4 days! She also did not care explaining why Skype members are not being warned that using Skype from selected countries can link their accounts to some dodgy Skype substitutes. This is my 2nd run in with Skype's shocking customer service in 4 weeks, both were equally ridiculous and frustrating. Skype used to be my favourite service, but it has hit rock bottom, time for a replacement.	2015-07-11	1
Expensive and service is auful!	If you need Skype for any sort of chat/voice/video that deos NOT include using a regular mobile or landline telephone connection Skype is competative - However if you need to use it in order to purchase a telephone number is any of a wide variety of countries - avoid it like a plague because the prices are truly outrageous ($6 a month compared to $0-$1 a month by average of the sites that I examined - and if you want a refund  - keep on dreaming!	2015-06-13	2
Your SKYPE account may be locked any time and SKYPE will keep your money	"DO NOT TOP UP YOUR SKYPE ACCOUNT!!!It is probably rated TOP SECRET and above by Microsoft... how many accounts have been locked due to their software failure and later the inability to say the simple word ""Sorry""... what is even worse is that third party attempting to infiltrate your account to prevent sending your messages as in cases with human rights violation... leads automatically to lock down of the account. In a way that means that the government can shut down now practically all your accounts GMAIL, SKYPE, YAHOO, FACEBOOK by just attempting to sign in... to recover your account is unfortunately not that simple. Basically if you give SKYPE all the information it ask from you, you shouldn't wonder if your bank account is infiltrated thereafter:SKYPE and Microsoft are aware of it and yet willingly or unwillingly they are supporting criminals and militant regimes with their inability to see pass their rules of secrecy...Considering the absolute disinterest from Microsoft to provide adequate service and take customer seriously... there is only one conclusion possible. The independent SKYPE was too much of annoyance for corporate America... as long SKYPE existed no one would have made money. Considering the amount Microsoft paid for SKYPE and the disinterest now it is more than a conspiracy theory. The new way of doing business... buy it, run it down and dispose of it. If Microsoft was the alone buyer or it was a joint venture we will of course never know. What we have here is a war between corporate America and the independent world of the free users. Most of us are using Facebook and despite the poor quality still hanging to the ruins of SKYPE without giving it a thought... no wonder with generation of papa Simpson coming into being we have never been in graver danger to go under the wheels of the corporate and government whimsicalities.Stop using SKYPE or you are putting your life and the life of other people in danger.Jani Jakimov"	2015-05-20	1
Great Product Killed by Microsoft	I have been using skype for several years in work capacity. It was a fabulous product until MS took over. Since then it has been on a downhill due to Microsoft trying to monopolise it and add unnecessary features to it to make profits out of the software.Very poor stability, awful user experience, application unstable most of the time, Inability to answer calls, multiple interfaces kicking up on incoming calls, issues when multiple sound devices connected and the list goes on. Shameful for a company like MS who has huge brain, technology and financial resources.	2015-04-09	1
Skype credit waste of money	I sent a number of Skype sms text to my girlfriend's mobile and she received none of the messages, although I have £10 of credit.  After making the messages I was charged for them (the Skype credit has deductions made for the messages) and it says that they were delivered but she did not receive them.  When I use my regular Tesco mobile to contact her she receives the message.  I think Skype free services are excellent but their sms to a foreign mobile (UK to Austria) are a waste of money.  I only lost £10.  I suppose they collect revenue for their free services this way :-)  Last £10 you'll get from me.	2015-03-22	1
Avoid Using Payment Services	I have had been using Skype for a few years as a free user, I starting working away from home so I subscribed to a Skype service with a recurring payment. Everything seemed great, then one day I received an email stated my email address had changed, then shortly after I received two emails from PayPal referring to two successful payments to Skype (this was all at the beginning of Oct 2013). I had not changed my email or made the payment so I tried to contact Skype, unfortunately Skype don't have a helpline number, they do have web chat but you need to log in, and at this time my password had also been changed by the person that had taken over my account. So I had to complete an online form, I received a reference and a note stating someone would contact me within 24hours. At this point someone was taking money from my account and Skype wanted me to wait, I contacted PayPal who stated that the payment was automatic so couldn't be stopped, so I phoned my bank, they stopped all payment to PayPal and the payment in process. So the next day I received an email from Skype stating that something with my request was incorrect and I was to follow a link to complete an online form, I selected the link which took me to the same page as I completed the day before, so I completed the form and also emailed Skype contactus address, again the message stated I would receive and email within 24 hours and again the same email back, to complete the online form. I replied to the emails but with no response, this went on until later November. So as I was getting nowhere I started to get fed up, so I tried the forgot password link after a few weeks of trying to change my password, I received a new one. So I could now access my account, when I logged into the account I noticed I was in credit for the two payment, so I tried the web chat to solve the problem but the guy told me to follow a link or try the contactus email, the link was for the online that I completed at the start, but I tried the form again but was still doing something wrong so nobody would help me, so I asked the online chat to help but again the same link. This went on for a bit, then in about March 2014 I received an email stating my account had been taken over so was block to protect me (5 months after I reported it), I tried to resolve the issue but got fed up, so stopped using Skype. It is now January 2015 and received an email stating my balance is due to expiry, this is to an account that is blocked.I am not saying don't use Skype because the free service is good but what ever you do don't use any paid service because your money isn't safe. When I had my problems I also posted it on the Skype online community, to my surprise I found that I wasn't alone and many people had lost money, some in the hundreds but Skype aren't interested.	2015-01-22	1
A Joke	This site promises to be user friendly but its just not I can never get my contact list to show up its just ridiculous	2014-07-29	2
not so good	It is not so good as I have excepted. I AM disappointed	2014-07-23	2
I Love Skype	Skype has the best video call conference quality. I've been using Skype for ages now and I'm really happy with what they have to offer.	2014-05-28	5
Skype online shop not greatest service	"Update: After much time, many emails with requests and very bad reviews online, I finally managed to get my discount, so I change this review from 1 to 3 stars.Background: I was purchasing an item online, and it had a 20% discount on it. First of all, it took very long for Skype online shop to process my order. Second, they ""forgot"" about the discount. Then, when I contacted customer support, they assured me they would take care of it. Nothing happened. I asked and asked, they said they would deal with it. Month and a half - and nothing has happened!Furthermore, as I live in Denmark with very high customs fees, I only wanted to buy something shipped out of Europe to avoid customs fees. This product was shipped out of Hong Kong, which they mentioned nothing about online. I contacted customer support also about this, and the same thing happened: They said they would deal with it, ""rest assured"" and other meaningless words, and nothing has ever happened. Finally, the product is not the quality that was described online at all! The price for that product was way too high for its value. Be careful."	2014-05-14	3
been using skype for a few years but now it hangs on my laptop	It's trying to log in but it hangs.	2014-05-07	3
Dont touch with a barge pole	Rubbish company living in the past:- Can't have a UK wide number as they have run out - I would have to take a number allocated for a different region in the UK (not suitable for business)- Can't change a personal account to a business account- Awful customer support - only online chat available which takes forever.Utter Rubbish!!	2013-12-13	1
Inability to secure you account against fraud, horrible customer service.	"In the past three months I have lost just under $100 from spammers on Skype. My account was used as a spammer's delivery tool in Sweden. Over one-thousand SMS texts were sent from my account - half in September and half early November. In September, a hacker gained access to my account and began to spam people in Sweden with texts. I promptly went to Skype customer service - attempted to resolve the issue, be refunded and move on. We took all the necessary steps to recover my account and make sure that nobody gained access to it again. Customer service agreed to refund me for the ""Auto-recharge"" cycles that occurred 5 times during the hacker's shenanigans and cost me $14 each time.Since then I have cancelled auto-recharge.However, I have still not been refunded.If that isn't enough - in the past few days THE EXACT SAME THING has happened to me. I followed the same steps, talked to Skype customer service.. did all of the security measures to ensure that it didn't happen again. I explained to them that even though my ""auto-recharge"" was turned off - it WAS STILL HAPPENING. They promptly continued on with the same security measures that did not protect me the first time... or the second time. Upon me asking for a refund due to their inability to secure my account, the customer service rep then told me that it's not their responsibility. Allow me to make that clear to anyone willing to give Skype their personal information and/or money - IT IS NOT SKYPES' RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP YOUR ACCOUNT SECURED.After spending 1.5hrs on the live chat with a customer service rep dodging my requests for a refund, he told me that they needed to ""convert this communication to email so we could further investigate the said issue"". On my approval of this ""conversion"" the chat was ended by the rep. Full transcript available on request."	2013-11-10	1
Fraud activity that Skype didn't want to deal with!	"I had a fraud activity on my account and reported it to Skype. First of all, it takes ""years"" to reach a customer representative via email, second of all when you finally reach them, representatives start playing a ping-pong email game, third they told me that i did have a fraud activity on my account and said that they will transfer to a different department that will take care of my case and will give me my money back. Two weeks passed and nothing happened. I keep contacting Harold G. who was helping me with my case and he just simply doesn't answer. I decided to contact my bank and let them take care of it. I am disappointed with Skype and deleted my account and application from everywhere. Don't want to deal with unprofessionals. Such a big company and doesn't know how to take care of its customers. SHAME!"	2013-10-31	1
it sucks	skype sucks big time crap why did msn force us to switch to this crappy thing with such crappy servie trying to charge us for somting we once had for free this is all just B.S GIVE US BACK OUR PLAIN OLD MSN MESANGER. NOT IMPRESSED WITH SKYPE WHAT SO EVER IT IS HARD TO USE	2013-04-26	1
it should be a 0 star	It is really painful to add credits for international calling.	2013-04-08	1
It doesn't replace MSN at all...	Skype has been a horrible experience so far, it doesn't replace MSN at all. While MSN provides comfortable chatting with friends with more free customizations, Skype is only convenient for video call. It doesn't take into consideration user's other needs as a messenger. I want to make my chatting window smaller so i can chat and watch vid at the same time, Skype screen smallest size still takes over half the screen. I want to customize my text into different color depending on who i chat with, I can't. I want to change background of my chat room I can't. Skype is so fucking boring, the only reasonable feature it provides is video call. It doesn't cater to none call related users who simply want a light IM messenger free of charge.	2013-04-02	1
Unfair Charges	Have been speaking to Skype support for weeks about unfair charges, with no result what so ever. When I call a land-line sometimes Skype starts charging even if nobody picked up, I can hear the ring tone but Skype is charging and I end up paying for connection and for the first minute even though nobody picked up.Also Skype rounds the charge into their favor. I call to a country and the charges are following: Connection fee 7.6p and a minute is 6.9 total 14.5p, but Skype charges 15p, they round this into their favor.I am not paying to Skype any more, will be using only their free services and for paying services will go to other provider.I would not recommend using Skype paid for services, it is a RIP OFF	2013-03-26	3
Video call? Oh if only!	"I have always been a keen MSN user and have had no troube using the MSN video chat feature.  The latest update of MSN indicates a ""merge"" with Skype, forcing me to have a Skype account (oh goodie!).  So I tried my brand spanking new Skype system to have a much needed catch up with my long distance boyfriend.  Skype was VEEERRRYYYY slow.  Infact I had to cease all other activities in order for it to open properly.  Then came the much awaited video call...... or an attempt at it.  I saw more ""slow connection"" ""connection error"" messages than I did of my partners face.  The connection was the worst I have ever experienced.  I decided to close down the amazing new Skype and recall via the MSN messenger - which suprisingly had no trouble what so ever delivering a successful video call.  My mysterious connection problems seemed to disappear, so the problem is with Skype.  Not a great first experience really.  It was like using dial up!"	2013-03-13	1
A bit worse after acquisition by Microsoft	More ADs, unstable mobile app updates, etc...	2013-03-11	4
Heavily Disappointed	"Lets sum it all up in 5 dot points:- It messes with my Google Chrome, and it is a pain to fix.- There are major issues in transferring contacts from facebook, and even searching for solutions on the internet, I never found out the problem.- Customer service can do with a lot more work.- Freezes my laptop, even when it's the only thing running- All-In-All, Skype is a waste of time, and is a pain to use.I wanna give it half or no stars, but I can't do that. So the lowest I can go is ""ONE"" star."	2013-02-09	1
Great service, just needs some work.	Skype is a great way to keep in touch with friends and family but there are several bugs that make the system not-so user friendly and difficult to maintain a connection. I consistently have to disconnect and reestablish a connection however, when it works, it's a great service!	2013-02-05	4
Old Software ROCKS - HORRIBLE TERRIBLE AWFUL Customer service	"So, the new software that 'improved' the Skype experience is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  I could not use it and had to go steal the old program off of my husband's hard drive, erase the new version and re-install since I was not able to download an old version of the software anywhere online that I saw.  The old Skype interface for Mac is A+. I love it.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I'm using version 2.0.8.866. The customer service at Skype is 100% INEXCUSABLY AWFUL HORRIBLE TERRIBLE.  I can't be any  more clear than this.  If you have a problem with your account or your software, pucker up and kiss your patience goodbye.  You will NOT be able to locate useful information on their website.  You will NOT be able to reach a customer service rep that will help you or be useful other than them doing a GREAT job of taking 18  minutes to answer one question incorrectly.  I know that it's not on purpose that things are this way, but Jesus.  I've been on chat for 27 minutes now and nobody can answer the question ""why can't I renew my skype number for 12 months instead of only 3"".  I can't believe that it's taking this long.  These people are totally incompetent."	2013-01-12	2
Latest version has problems	The latest version of skype is configured in such a way that it is no longer clear where to find your Contacts list; in fact, I have spent the last hour looking and am still unable to call skype-to-skype to any of my contacts.  According to one of the support threads, I'm not the only one who has experienced this problem. I'm very disappointed by skype and hope they can solve this problem.	2013-01-06	2
Skype Gives You Malware	Skype has added malware to its software that takes control of your computer and prevents it from accessing Google and Gmail and takes over your browsers to require that you use Babylon, a malware search engine.  Skype downloaded Babylon, Bloson, Price Beep and Password Box, as well as several other malware programs, all for the sake of their making a few cents off these malicious programs.  Skype's anti-service and anti-user practices are reprehensible and deserving of stern condemnation.  It took a half day to remove the malicious programs Skype caused my computer to be infected with.  I caution anyone considering using Skype to use great caution when downloading the service.	2013-01-05	1
Gift card scam	Wanted to ordered a Skype gift voucher from Skype official site and was redirected to ChatAndVision. After one day they delivered the voucher by email, but it never worked (even tried multiple times and with different accounts). Contected support. Responded after 2+ days. No use. Avoid.	2012-12-24	1
Deceptive marketing, huge waste of time- avoid Skype!	I spent 20 minutes with Skype's overly complex, many-page sign in process, and even bought $10 worth of credit to begin calling, only to find out they want $30 a year just to have a number to call from. If they're going to charge that, they need to post it up front, on their very first page, not hide it after you have wasted time and money signing up for their ripoff service.	2012-11-29	1
Skype keeps me connected	I moved away from my family from TX to HI and have been using Skype video calls to keep in contact and let my 2 year old nephew get to know me. I can only make a trip out to TX once a year so having him know my face is a really big deal for me. I also use Skype to talk to my boss and co-workers when working on projects. It helps me co-ordinate and get my questions answered faster than email would.	2012-11-14	5
Kick Ass for Long Distance Family and Work Calls	"I use Skype for both personal and business needs.  I especially love the fact that I can screen-share while working with a trainee or one of my fellow contractors.  The video chat comes in handy when the kiddos want to chat with relatives that aren't local....and sometimes even the local ones!I really don't have anything negative to say.  I suppose I would like a ""mark as un-read"" option for some of my work dialogue, but that's not too big of a deal."	2012-10-30	5
Skype keeps me in touch with family.	We live in a world where people are so far apart. Friends from high school and college and family members are spread all over the country. Skype gave me the ability to not only talk to them, but also see them through video chat. I have been able to see my nieces and nephews grow up even thought I'm not near them Instead of meeting every Christmas, I get to see my family every week. The same goes for my friends from school that live in other states and even other countries. Skype has let me keep in touch with the people that I love.	2012-10-23	4
My second cellphone	This thing makes life much easier. It gives me an opportunity to take interviews, have conversations with friends and collegues not just on my pc, but on the go as well. Love it!	2012-10-18	5
Excellent!!	Great way to communicate with a great value.	2012-09-27	5
I love skype	This is one of the greatest things ever.I love talking to my sister who lives in NY face to face.I feel like we still live together and have not missed anything.It is amazing seeing her everyday	2012-09-18	4
This.. Is... Genius	"I am personally online very much of the day. Instead of owning a smartphone i just use skype, i have made a little list why i love skype.1. It's free. And i mean completly free, no ""2 hours a week-rule""2. It's easy, fast and reliable.3. Amazing sound quality. It will go as far as your microphone will.4. Webcam? Share your screen? They got it all."	2012-09-11	5
Good service	Good service and low prices	2012-08-31	5
Removing Subscriptions: A web of confusion and deception	I have been a skype user since there were just 30,000 users on the system. A long time. I have enjoyed many good years and hundreds of hours with friends and relatives all over the world.On the strength of this I created a Business account, added my credit card details, added work colleagues, never really benefitted from group screen sharing because it never worked and it turned out to be an expensive console to add or remove members.I have tried to cancel the subscription on my credit card, but it has not been possible because it tells me I should transfer credits to a user before I can do this. There is no way to do this because the web page for months has given me a system error. Today I received another subscription payment notification with my credit card statement...just to add further insult to injury! It's not even possible to delete an account. What's that all about? Even Facebook deletes photos now!Skype customer services hides behind pages of inter-linked information that goes around in circles of Q&A pages and when I have been able to find a mail address to write to I don't get an answer.Very disappointing. Now I use Viber.	2012-08-24	1
The software needs a bit of work - a bit intrusive	The service is great - super useful. However, the software needs a lot of work.The settings are difficult to use and are not organised logically.The default sounds Skype ships with are horrible.Screen sharing now costs money? I understand that they need to make money - but I feel like I may need to look for a new alternative.	2012-08-20	4
Great service	I use it for all my long distance calls and it is a fantastic tool to keep phone bills under control.	2012-08-02	5
IP telephony FTW	I use Skype most of the time and my phone bills are ridiculously low. Fantastic, low-priced service.	2012-07-26	5

Great program	I use Skype on my phone very frequently. Definitely very useful way of communication and very convenient.	2012-07-24	5
Very good program	I am using it often and it has saved considerable amount of money to me.	2012-07-24	5
Awesome application	I am using Skype regularly for all my long distance calls. It is incredibly convenient and cheap, I highly recommend it.	2012-07-23	5
Very good	Skype is an excellent way to communicate with people who live abroad, without spending too much on expensive land lines.	2012-07-21	4
Family reunion, virtually!	Thanks to Skype I can now see my grand daughters from across the country! This is great because getting most young kids on the phone for longer than a minute is hard. Give them video of themselves and me to star at and make funny faces helps keep their attention. Great product especially for free!	2012-07-18	5
Easy and moneysafe!	Does not required speed internet, more than enough WiFi connection and mobile internet	2012-07-17	5
I Love It!	I am in love with Skype I can chat for hours on end with people around the globe.  Its absolutely fabulous! Even though if you want to make a call you have to pay how cares its cheap and easy to do.  Some people would prefer not paying so you can still chat if you have a webcam you can make a video call.	2012-07-16	5
best video chat	best video chat software. really  like the simplicity of the messenger and great quality video communication.	2012-07-16	5

What can be better than seeing your grand children as and when you want to.	My grand children don't live close enough to me so Skype is my answer to having tea parties on screen with grand kids and there dolls/bears and who ever else is invited including bringing in other family on same chat, it is so brilliant as a family we have all sat chatting, watching the kids at play whilst drinking tea/coffee.  I can think of nothing better apart from living next door to my family.	2012-07-11	5
Sometimes easy	It's easy, but it's a pity that internetconnection is not available in certain area's. So: Skyping in not possible. It happened also once that a message that was send to me, was delivered 3 days later.	2012-07-11	4
jAlbum.net	I have tried almost all applications to create albums for the Web. Compared with JAlbum some are easier to use but it is profitable to devote two or three sessions to learn JAlbum thoroughly, then he discovers powerful options and practical features not found in more expensive commercial programs. I am very satisfied with the purchase although I have not experienced the sale of pictures and videos through PayPal, one of the distinctive possibilities of JAlbum. Very good!	2012-07-10	5
Awesome site for Cam chat all over the globe!	This is the best site that has proven extra-ordinary from it's counterparts. Glad to see that Facebook has the integration of Skype. So far, I never had any issues in using this product. Even downloading it from it's native site was no big deal. Am still a regular user of this product and I wholeheartedly recommend this product to all, because all the services including the customer service, is carried out so nicely by the corporate.	2012-07-10	5
Cheaper than paying.	The phrase 'At least we're not paying for this' is often used in my Skype conversations, which is definitely true. If I had to pay for a shoddy video and distorted sound I would be royally pissed off. Thankfully I don't. But the reason I use Skype, apart from it being free, is that I am travelling. I must state that one reason for my terrible phone conversations could have something to do with the hostel's wi-fi connection, but half the time such an excuse is not valid. But it does the job (except when the call unexpectedly drops) and hey, at least I'm not paying for it.	2012-07-09	2
Amazing	Thanks SKYPE to reduce my telephone bills. I can not only talk to my love once but can see them too... Thank you	2012-07-09	5
great for video linking all over the world to chat in video	great for video linking all over the world to chat in video	2012-07-08	5
Skype me	Traveling abroad was always a challenge when it came time to phone home....now I am only a Skype call away.  Also great for family video calls and conversations with on line gaming.	2012-07-08	4
Easy to use	Very easy to use and lag free	2012-07-07	5
Relied on for home and business!	There is nothing better so far for VOIP that I know of!It's clear (almost CD quality with the right mics) and nearly always faultless.The webcam, group call and IM features are great also!Not to mention it's available on nearly all smart phone platforms for free WiFi calls abroad :)Keep up the good work guys!	2012-07-06	5
Skype is great, but seems to slow PC down	Is just my PC or does skype seem to make everything else go slow!	2012-07-06	4

Skype is great	This just makes it so easy to call over seas and it is very affordable	2012-07-03	5
hmm :/	well skype could deffo be better,the quality is not always the best and sync is sometimes out,on the other hand it is the cheapest way to contact your friends around the world and it is free to call skype to skype which is excellent! good program to download if you have family to far away and you just want to chat!	2012-07-03	3
Overall it's invaluable	I use Skype on my iPad and have found really useful when I'm travelling and with more and more businesses using it, it's become an accepted means of communicating in business.  There have been one or two glitches for me with SMS messaging where messages have been delayed by a number of days, but no evidence of a delay at my end.  But this is an isolated incident.  Overall, it's invaluable.	2012-07-03	4
faboulous!	what a great way to keep ion contact with my family and friends back home.sometimes its a bit laggy but ther then that its great!	2012-07-03	4
5 star complete communication	what's more it's free	2012-07-02	5
Awful.	I have 100mb internet, my internet is phenomenal. Skype, however, isn't. For once i'd like a conversation with no lag, no jittery video and no out of synch audio,	2012-07-01	1
doesn't work	half the time it doesn't work or it crashes but i do like it.	2012-07-01	2
Skype	Great to be able to talk and see your family and friends that live far away from you xxx	2012-06-30	4
Best communication software	Its greatest value is in it that it saves you insane amounts of money for long distance calls.	2012-06-29	5
nothing much said MS screwed it	nothing much said MS screwed it	2012-06-28	5
Easy to use communication site	I use this to call Australia weekly, and it doesn't cost much at all compared to land line	2012-06-28	5
worked pretty good	had a long distance relationship going for a few months, we communicated on skype through facebook.  it was pretty reliable and great to realize that technology let my man meow to my cats from 1200 miles away	2012-06-28	4
best internet phone/video chat service around	clear cut picture with solid connection. easy to use. a few clicks and your away chatting	2012-06-27	5
A good programme but a nuisance	Takes up too much on the computer and takes ages to load. It rather gets in the way. I don't use it often but when I do it proves its worth.It is also irritating that this is yet another programme that lets in Spam,	2012-06-25	2
So easy to use!	I live quite far away from my family so Skype is great for keeping in touch! It's great to let the family see how the little one is growing up too, until we can visit next. And it's free - what more do you want?!	2012-06-24	5
My hubby is in the army, and we couldn't live with out SKYPE when he was deployed!!!	Skype would have got 5 stars, but the video likes to freeze up and calls get dropped, but what can u do when it's free and ur talking to people in different counties. I <3 skype and can't thank them enough it made his 12 month deployment easier on both of us. We skyped everyday several times per day!!!!! THX SKYPE!!!!!!!!!!!	2012-06-23	4
Talk to my husband every day on skype!	I love Skype it is a great affordable was to communicate. I talk over the phone with my husband everyday and only pay 2.99 a month!	2012-06-20	5
Skypeople...............	Skype is excellent.  It enables me to be in contact with family in Australia, Canada and other parts of the world.Keep up the good work!!!	2012-06-18	4
Brilliant when it works properly	I Skype with my son in California (I live in England) and it's great when it works, but sometimes we have problems.  Mostly, though, it's amazing to see my son and his family every week and we really enjoy our time on Skype.	2012-06-18	4
Expired credits are always unacceptable	I like Skype - and it works well enough.  However, the idea that my credits expired over time (a few years ago) is something I cannot tolerate.  We give money to them in advance - which means they have our money for a time without having to provide a service, then they tell us that we have to use them within a certain time period of they will confiscate the credits.  This is very poorly thought out approach since it alienates the customer for good.  It is like insult added to injury.If this policy were not in place, I would still be a spending customer with Skype.  The net profit for Skype with me would have been in the positive.  I'm afraid that this is a poor decision made by management that will cost Skype in the end.	2012-06-17	2
so so	keeps crashing my computer & made it run slower also skype keeps crashing mid way through a hat, but has its uses when it works its could ,	2012-06-15	3
Perfect for long distance calls	I'm always using skype services when I want to make long distance call with relatives. The quality of sound and image are very good.	2012-06-15	5
Great, cheap way to communicate internationally	Me & my partner communicate using Skype all the time, either through the laptops or iPhones because we are currently living in different countries and in a long distance relationship. It is a great, free way to stay in touch and it makes it slightly easier been so far away from each other for long periods of time! I know dont know what we would do without Skype!	2012-06-14	5
awesome!	i love skype but i think that not enough people use it! they should promote it more and make it less confusing to use like the paying for calls and tryng to find contacts.	2012-06-12	4
excellent	speech quality has improved.	2012-06-11	5
Genius	You are truly genius to enable us to talk to family and friends, all over the world, for free! Thank you soo much.	2012-06-07	5
best free way to keep in touch	The best thing about Skype is that you don't have to pay to use it. You can do video chats or just use it as a messenger  very helpful tool.	2012-06-06	5
Skype	I really do like skype. It's made connection to people in other areas, and countries so much easier. And it's FREE! What more can you want? PLUS, you get to see the other people. They're a little problems, such a connection and clarity, but that's minor when you consider all the good factors.	2012-06-04	4
By enlarge lousy service	... need I say more?	2012-06-03	2
Greatest invention in a long time.	I find that Skype is one of the most innovative apps to come out. It really is nice to connect to family and friends and be able to do it face to face. Love it.	2012-06-02	5
BEST APP IN INTERNET	EASY TO USE THAT MEETS OUR NEEDS	2012-05-31	4
Free 1-800 calls anywhere	When I am traveling around the world and need to call to airlines, credit card companies, financial companies, or businesses back in the US I use SKYPE to make those calls free.  I even use them at home instead of my cell phone for those long waits for 1-800 service.  Also, calls home are very cheap and easy to make from a good wifi connection with my iPad compared to using an international phone card from public phones.   I don't use the video feature very much, just the audio and most calls come through better than my ATT cell phone unless the wifi is really boggy.	2012-05-31	5
Sometimes not worth trying to have a converation.	Living in Spain I thought it would be the best way to stay in touch with family and friends in the UK but quite often we lose contact so many times that we give up.  It is seldom possible to be able to see each other and I have been really disappointed.	2012-05-30	2
Excellent	My cool website ...I love Skype!	2012-05-29	5

EXCELLENT	I use it as my primary communication system.	2012-05-11	5
wicked	as i just recently registered, and got to speak and see my family across the other side of the world, its really good	2012-05-10	4
Good product	As a free product, excellent, tho info is a bit hidden and no easy 'contact us'.	2012-05-10	4
Lover Skype!	I love Skype! Since I live abroad from my family and have friends all over the world it saved me so much money!!!10 out of 5 stars!	2012-05-08	5
It was a great idea	The free service was weak and always dropped my calls. I did pay for one month at the cheapest package. It was a slight bit better but not much approved. My internet connection was fine i even tried another service and it worked a lot better. Dont pay them for this service.	2012-05-08	2
great quality and service	My son uses skype for online learning from a Tutor in Pakistan and it works great, we havent had any issues with this and if people can use it as a business tool then thats great.	2012-05-08	5
Perfect	Great to be able to speak to and see all my family from the comfort of my armchair.	2012-05-04	5
Its easy and FREEE!	Its easy to use, its effective and best of all its FREE.	2012-05-03	4
stable	stable chatting	2012-04-28	5
Great!	Impossible to live without anymore)	2012-04-28	5
The best way to communicate overseas	The flexibility of Skype is brilliant.  When we travel we can call family and friends with and with out computers, with and without access to wifi and with and without cameras.  Furthermore, the quality of sound and pictures just keeps on getting better and when you ring telephones the cost is negligible.	2012-04-27	5
Simply the BEST !!!	I can't say enough for what this technology and product has done to staying in touch with family & friends across the globe.You guys are FABulous and second to none !! ... I thank GOD for such a medium of communication !!!	2012-04-27	5
the way to stay in contact with your family	it is very nice to speak with my family in australiai am very happy with it	2012-04-25	5
Great to okay, depending what you are looking for	"I use Skype mainly for intercontinental calls. Whilst there are indoubted cost benefits the quality of the ""line"" (audio over IP) is often very poor with interference and or dropping of sound.If you want to save money - great!If you expect comparable quality to a phoneline - you might be disappointed!"	2012-04-25	3
great	I get one refund with them very easily. easy communication.	2012-04-22	5
Turning 10,000 miles into next to you on the sofa	Skype crosses oceans, time zones and the restraints of expensive call charges. You can talk to someone on the opposite side of the globe face to face whenever you want at no cost.	2012-04-21	5
What is it	Never been able to get my head aroiund this one. Leaving well alone.	2012-04-18	1
Wonderful to be able to keep in touch	I love the way if I want to chat with my mum or other friends and family I can: face to face.  I use Skype and it's just the best.  My mum can see the children and what they are up to... the only down side is she can also see when I need to do the housework.	2012-04-17	5
Good, but can be inproved	It is really useful when travelling, but some things can be improved. It will be interesting if the option of opening files to share in the communication was added to the software. Anyway, for calls, I totally recommend it	2012-04-17	4
Very good	Its funny to have contact whith freinds who dont live next to you	2012-04-17	5
Great until you need help	I loved Skype, easy to use and keeps costs down.Then when I needed some assistance (they over billed me) it took an age to solve.	2012-04-17	2
My hub to family abroad	I use skype very regularly, first to chat with my girlfriend abroad, and since I moved to her, to contact my family. No complaintes, although at certain moments in time the line could be more crisp.	2012-04-12	4
i love skype	i love skype specially video calls	2012-04-12	5
Brill!	No probs, works great, if both parties enjoy a fast connection to the web.	2012-04-11	5
Best all around!	"If you want to ""Reach out and Touch someone"" Skype away!"	2012-04-11	5
yahoooo Free video calls awesome...!	yahoooo Free video calls awesome...!	2012-04-10	5
Nice?	I looooooove this service!!!! I used to just instant message and text message my girlfriend and friends but now I can see them through this service. You never know who you are talking to until you see them personally and this allows you to do just that	2012-04-09	4
Best Video Chat	Skype: easy to use and it allows you to video chat with others no matter how far away they are.	2012-04-09	5
Great communication tool on many different computers.	I always use Skype on my PC and my iPhone, since I can carry video call with friends and family, using 3G/4G, not just WiFi.	2012-04-08	5
Excellant	My parents are hearing impaired & it is awesome for talking to my parents since we cant talk like most families.Awesome for talking to family that live abroad.	2012-04-05	5
AN all in one communication tool...	Boy  - I even SMS calendar schedules to myself with it - It is like a phone, a fax, a PDA and a chat system all at my fingertips...	2012-04-01	5
How amazing is SKYPE?!!	Make video and phone calls to family and friends all over the world.  One of the best inventions on the planet!	2012-03-29	5
Absolutely no customer service.	I really liked the skype until my account was hacked by someone in Russia. Luckily, I caught it before they racked up too much, under $100, but despite all of my efforts I could not get in touch with any type of customer service from skype. I just wanted to make sure this would never happen again, but they obvsiouly had no interest in helping their customers, even when they are the victim. I will never use skype again for this reason. I cannot trust a company that will allow my information to be hacked and then provide no customer service to console me.	2012-03-28	1
Good call quality - Bad customer service	Most used phone company. Calls to Cuba are very expensive. Please lower your rates to Cuba and offer monthly rates. Customer service is simply unacceptable. I was overcharged for several calls, asked to adjust, received no reply.	2012-03-28	3
I get to see my new grandbaby up close without having to leave home!	My daughter lives in another state and I am unable to fly there to see my first (and probably) only grand child in real life.   Skype is amazing!  The picture is SO clear and usually the voice is as if we are right beside each other as we visit.    I can see the baby stretch and smile and sleep while my daughter and I talk to each other.   Life is GREAT!  Skype is GREAT!	2012-03-26	5
love it :-) video chat with my mates in Oz	perfect way of keeping in touch with my friends living down under... with an added bonus of video calling it's like being there in person - without the sun of course :-(	2012-03-26	5
sometimes I use it	sometimes I use it	2012-03-25	4
Completely unreliable and how to complain?	Rely on Skype but is hapless and hopelessly useless at the MO!	2012-03-25	2
Brilliant Service	What a great way to contact family and friends when tou are away from home	2012-03-25	4
Need to Improve on your Linux version	Your windows version should never be better than your linux version.	2012-03-24	4
Use it every day!	It's nice and all but take back the 'plugins' and remove the add. Also fix the weird looking interface. Thanks!	2012-03-24	4
Talk and share	Skype is very efficient to share files and talk online. I use it daily and I love it! Their program looks very nice and has many features. Their calling prices to landlines and stuff like that are cheap.It's too epic to describe!	2012-03-23	5
A lifesaver when overseas	While spending a year in Europe, Skype made it so that my family was never too far. Either the paid service or the free service is worth doing. (Maybe cancel your expensive long distance plan and get the phone app too!)	2012-03-22	5
Cool, free and connects	I love that I can talk with my mum who is in another country on my iPhone for free! Thank you Skype, you're doing amazing job.	2012-03-22	4
My family connection	I live thousands of miles from my family in Malaysia so Skype is like my connection to my family. It's great to be able to speak with them and to see them on Skype especially when I miss home so I appreciate Skype very much. Without it, the world would be a lonely place. Thank you Skype.	2012-03-21	5
My business is transformed through Skype	Apart from the moments when the connection goes dead, particarly when I use my online phone number, Skype is great. We use it on a day to day basis to show each other what we see on our screens and to work together with people all across the continent.	2012-03-21	4
Fantastic	On an  extended trip abroad and having elderly relatives (none computer owners) I need to keep in touch with I checked out various ways of making cheap telephone calls. I have found Skype by far the most convenient, easiest and cheapest way of doing this. So easy to add more credit and very low prices.	2012-03-21	5
Close family?  Yes but we live in Oz, USA & France!	Thank you Skype for keeping our family in touch through good times and bad.  It's wonderful to see eachother and to show thinks as well as tell.  My cats met their Australian furry cousins on screen!  Our first grandchild thinks we live inside the computer!  Thanks for making it all possible.	2012-03-21	5
I love Skype!!!	I am a huge fan of Skype! I get to see family and frinds abroad for free at the cilck of a button!!! Amazing!	2012-03-21	5
Skype Super	I Chose Skype because I can communicate with distant relatives	2012-03-16	5
Life saver	Skype is amazing. The fact that I can talk, for free, to people all over the world, is something to behold! I worry about a day when this will start to cost.	2012-03-15	5
Bad Connection , poor or none customers support	The sound quality is quite bad, impossible to use with iPhone without WiFi.Would not recommend to use paid services.	2012-03-14	1
not bad	its good to for video chat but seem to be finding problem these days quite often... would be great if we could do group video chat.. but extra cost just turns off..	2012-03-13	3
skype	brings the otherside of the world into your living room	2012-03-13	5
Keeps my family in communication	I wish that the quality of video chat would be better, but other than that, I love that I can keep in contact with my sister when she's all the way on the other side of the country.	2012-03-11	4
Awesome!	What a peice of software! - Great for keeping in touch with friends & family.	2012-03-07	5
Skype, fun & free........ Fabulous	We use Skype's free video conversation link to speak with friends in Europe. Aside from slow connection issues, service provider not Skype related , we have found the experience rewarding & is an excellent way to keep in touch with those you care for.we haven't used the other Skype tools so can only comment as above.Recommended highly.	2012-03-07	5
Excellent tool	Excellent tool	2012-03-07	5
So so	I tried this company when they first came out and even with local calls the audio was low and callers couldn't hear me, even with headset, etc.	2012-03-06	2
A delightful way to hear from the grandchildren	When our daughter moved away to Australia with her husband we were so sad to see them both go, and even sadder to see our three grandchildren leave with them. The telephone of course is far too expensive, but SKYPE.COM gave us the perfect means of seeing our family grow up. I really can't say enough just how happy I am to have been shown this lovely lovely site.	2012-03-04	5
I use Skype every day, very useful: Screen Sharing	I use it every day because of its quick and perfect text and voice communication with friends, allowing to send files and links with the text. I like to see, if a friend is online now. You also can help friends by viewing on their desktop about Skype. This Screen Sharing feature (only in the newer Skype versions since version 4.1) is a similar function as the professional tool TeamViewer offers for this purpose.	2012-03-04	5
Incomparable	Talk, chat and videocall with friends from all over the world, stay in touch with loved ones and people you care about..for free!	2012-03-03	5
great idea, rubbish in reality	such a long delay on phone calls, drives me insane, wud rather pay!!	2012-03-03	1
Great idea for those who live abroad	Not sure Iif my mums loves skype even more than me, hehe, since I have an account  I call home more often and in the last year I even can see my family with the webcam...It definitely improved communications internationally. and is so cheap! or even free!However it sometimes have signal problems or echo	2012-02-27	4
Great way to keep in touch	One son in University another in Perth Western Australia, there is no better way of keeping in touch. AND IT'S FREE	2012-02-26	5
coooooool	really cool application.	2012-02-25	4
BigBusTours	Very professional!!!!	2012-02-23	5
the best company	' I Am Very Satisfied''	2012-02-23	5
Excellent!	I love Skype!  It's so neat to be able to talk to friends and family face to face.	2012-02-23	5
Great Company! I recommended them to my Son.	Great Company! I recommended them to my Son.I bought an ionizer from life ionizers about 3 years ago. I liked the fact that they customized my filtration system and the water has done wonders for my health. At 62 years of age I appreciate things that optimize my health and well being. I called up to get new filters and they told me how to maintain my machine, which was great. The good deal was that 3 years after I bought my machine they sent me a free one year membership in their alkaline lifestyle health community. Great information on having a healthier lifestyle!	2012-02-21	5
Life Changing	I can see my grandchildren on the other side of the world grow up	2012-02-21	5
Good	Wonderful VOIP service for international calls.  But MMS way too slow and uses too much band width for good video calls.	2012-02-19	4
brilliant!	i've been with Skype since it first started; they have shrunk the world - and for free! Please may that never change.	2012-02-19	5
No need to get that trip, Go Skype and keep the love!!!	I swear by Skype especially if we are talking about long distance love affair. This site helped my son maintained his 10 years long distance relationship with his girlfriend who happened to be living in the U.S. He didn't have a  US Visa so he couldn't visit her. Everyday since skype came into the picture, he get to see her and talk to her. Last December, they finally tied the knot. Both are now in the US. THANK YOu Skype!	2012-02-19	5
Love Skype	Skype gives me the ability to speak with my friends in other countries without spending 900$'s for the phonecall - it allows you to maintain your connection without charging you an arm and a leg.	2012-02-19	5
4 stars	it is so great to be able to keep in touch with family and friends when you are apart.... for free is even better!!	2012-02-19	4
easy to use	no real complains...sometimes some echo, but im ok with it.	2012-02-17	5
top service	skype lets us communicate with our daughter its excellent	2012-02-17	4
Online chat and meetings are great..... but	i've had less sucess with voice when trying to use it with a couple of parties inthe UK and one in India	2012-02-17	4
Skype for iPad is amazing	Skype on the iPad 2 is a most excellent product. It even works via 3G saving me on more than one occasion when I needed to make a phone call, but had forgotten my mobile phone! Brilliant!	2012-02-17	5
Excellent Quality calls to Cuba	I use Skype for all the call I make to Cuba.  I have excellent sound and little delay if any.  The time I buy is actual unlike many calling cards.  I recommend Skype for calling Cuba.	2012-02-16	5
moved from good to best !!	Best Service & easy to operate. Slowly- all my family and friends are now using it. Cannot survive without it;	2012-02-16	5
awesome quality	having never used skype before was highly impressed with its ease of use,and the clarity & quality of the phone calls	2012-02-15	5
Useful, but not perfect.	I use Skype a fair bit, it's ok i guess but get a fair few problems, and there is much better programs out there such as teamspeak which is my favourite	2012-02-15	3
Good most of the time	Skype, although I don use it much, is a great tool to maintain communication with distant people, business, friendship or pleasure. But in order to maintain that communication in desirable level, they need to improve it, because the laggines ruins it on video calls, even if you have great cam and internet speed. Other than that it does what it says most of the time.	2012-02-14	3
great	great opportunity to speak to anyone in the world for freegreat	2012-02-13	5
Making calls works great - receiving calls doesn't	Most incoming calls never ring on the iPhone 4S, don't even notify but go straight to voicemail.Competing products like Viber work like a charm for both incoming and outgoing calls.	2012-02-12	3
Great service	I love Skype. I've started using it for business as well now with one of the online numbers and it's saved me a lot of money.	2012-02-11	5
the best app	excellent service and fast delivery	2012-02-10	5
Used to be great, but the new version is too spaced out	The layout of the latest version of Skype is so wasteful of screen space it's almost impossible to use on a laptop.	2012-02-09	3
contact	skype lets me see my family abroad	2012-02-09	5
Awesome...	Skype is awesome, I use skype to make calls around the world with cheaper price to pay.	2012-02-09	5
A really great communication tool!	Easy to download, install and set-up. Great for chatting to family and friends abroad or in other parts of the country.  All you need is a web cam and a mike.  Couldn't be easier!	2012-02-08	5
Really handy that it works on iPhone	Works really well for face to face calls. iPhone FaceTime is probably better quality image but no good if the other person doesn't have an Apple product like iPhone or iPad!Fantastic when you're in another continent since you can load up credit and call to a land line back home at much lower rates.  You can even set it up so that your own phone number appears when you call that person back home.	2012-02-08	4
superb service	The best service for cheap calls.	2012-02-08	5
5 stars	Skype is very helpful service anywhere, at home, at hotel, in airport. If you can't live without contacts with your friends, parents or children s, this program for you. This is cheap, fast and secure. Forgot about mobile phone if you have Internet and Skype. I use Skype around 10 years and don't found best service in the world.	2012-02-08	5
EXCELLENT!!!	Skype is very useful. I rated it perfect!	2012-02-08	5
I luv this apps	It's great to get calls for free	2012-02-07	4
Video calls to Japan for FREE!!	My son and daughter-in-law live in Japan, and we regularly communicate via Skype. I can't express in words how nice it is to be able to SEE them both while we talk. It takes the thousands of miles away!!!	2012-02-06	5
great	a********************	2012-02-06	5
Can't really complain	You can call anyone anywhere who also has Skype for free.. Their prices for calls don't blow me away but they're OK. Overall can't really complain. Never had any major issues. Half decent mobile app.. Does suffer with some crashes though (iOS).	2012-02-05	5
What would life be like without skype	Skype has changed by life in so many ways, it's a great service and is very cheap. I have a world subscription and I can make calls to telephones in most countries of the world for free.. I could never have dreamed of this just a few years ago.   Thank you skype, you changed the world for me.	2012-02-05	5
Skype is a perfect tool for the modern world	It helps us so much when we are abroad then we can communicate every day on phone calls.	2012-02-04	5
Updated version's freezes	Updated version of skype of freezes the computer and the application is too slow.	2012-02-04	2
I wish we could have a site like this in this part of the world	It's a great site, where you can find whatever you need, contact the seller, solve problems . I've hused it more than 200 times... it's a pitty that the sites of ecommerce  developed locally here can´t achieve even a half of the quality of ebay...	2012-02-03	5
Still needs improvment	Skype is still the best option for overseas calling however they continue to struggle with consistent audio and video feeds. You would think by now they would have figured it out.	2012-02-02	3
excellent service	great way to keep in touch with friends	2012-02-02	5
Great Free Product	Would be perfect if they built a good web application (to bypass my company firewall that doesn't let me install new software).	2012-02-01	4
Save yourself money, phone abroad the cheap way.	We used to phone the USA and had a deal with BT. But our friends said get on Skype, I was talked through it and found it easy to set up. YOU DO NOT NEED A CAMERA as someone in the computer magazines insisted you did. We already had a mic and speakers. So set up was easy. I have told others about the site and the options they give you, including the option to FREE calls to the states via the internet. Most modern laptops already are set up for Skype, so there's no need to buy extra items. We saw the snow from their house as moving the laptop around you can broadcast to others. Skype gives you eyes on the world.	2012-01-31	5
Good	I love using it to talk to people that are far away, but as soon as I reach around an hour of talking to someone, it always seems to drop the call.	2012-01-30	4
great service love it	Great service love it	2012-01-29	4
":*'""*:•.-:¦:-•* FABULOUS * -:¦:- * HIGHLY RECOMMEND -:¦:-•:*'""*:"	The best thing since sliced bread----and its free.Every body should download and try it.Great for keeping in touch with family and friends. I chat to my son in Tenerife (and see him) every night and like I say its free.	2012-01-28	5
Great value for money	Everything is great, video and calling is great, however, the quality of the video and sound is questionable, but great value for money none the less	2012-01-28	4
calls drop often	Skype is very useful.  often times the calls drop.  But im happy skype app is available for smart phones.  He international rates are still not so competitive.  Hope your company can do something about the international call rates.	2012-01-27	3
sanda	connects me with friends and relatives	2012-01-26	5
Stay in touch!	Great way to stay in touch with friends and family all over the world!!	2012-01-26	5
Skype but should have more features	I would love to be able to juggle between my work and personal contacts, like appears offline for one list and online for another while using thevsamevaccount.	2012-01-25	3
High rating since I discovered Skype. I can see my son who has moved to Europe and it is great to be able to see and talk with him.	Great Job Skype. You bring families and friends together when no other way is possible.	2012-01-24	5
I do love SKype	Easy and comfortable to use	2012-01-24	5
Skype works great :)	I really do enjoy using Skype, only I seem to regularly have problems with my webcam...	2012-01-24	4
Bit glitchy	I like the service but it never seems to be very clear for me when I use video...	2012-01-23	3
Re Skype	The best video call site so far. I use skype every day to chat to my friend in America, I watch her getting her breakfast ready before she leaves for work, whilst I am thinking what to have for lunch as there is a five hour time difference between us, I love Skype, wouldn't be without it.	2012-01-23	5
Do I cheaper with Microsoft Live	Do I cheaper with Microsoft Live! I web-conference with my family in Australia every week for nothing more than the cost of my broadband	2012-01-22	2
Life Made Easy	Fantastic Idea Quick Easy & Cheap If You Call Anybody on Their Mobile Abroad	2012-01-21	5
HONESTY is the best.	Skype is great to see the good and bad of places out in the community.  Look at reviews before trying new places out.  THANKS for Skype	2012-01-21	5
Best Invention!	We were able to show all the family in various parts of the country the brand new baby in Honolulu.	2012-01-20	5
echo in the call	When calling on landline. The other line always hears an echo. I use headphones and I hear everything fine, but for the one I´m calling it´s very annoying.	2012-01-19	2
Wonderful	Thank you skype! Use subscription too,never had any worries about the payment or the service.	2012-01-18	5
It works	Not much to say.. Skype works and its free..!	2012-01-17	5
I really like this!	I really like skype - to be able to see people miles away and talk to them - fantastic. It is a pity that the video doesn't always work as well as it could - and the sound sync is a bit weird. Nonetheless, the benefits outweigh iffy quality.	2012-01-16	4
Great system for staying in touch with family and colleagues	Saves a lot of money on phone calls.  Seems to work really well 95% of the time.Would recommend to anyone	2012-01-15	5
Keepin up	Skype is one of the few ways I can stay in touch with all my family and friends while I am in Afghanistan. For that, I love it.	2012-01-14	5
The Nest Best Thing to Being There	We enjoy being able to visit and see our son, daughter-in-law and two youngest grandsons.  We live so far apart and do not get together very often.  So, seeing them is especially important.  Since it is free, it is even better.  Thanks Skype for all the hours of enjoyment you have given us.	2012-01-14	5
rate	good chat program and reliable	2012-01-14	5
Hopefully The Goose Doesn't Get Cooked	Affordable phone on your computer.Where else can you make a local call from half a world away?Just remember a USB phone style handset to eliminate the bugaboos of having a speaker transition to a microphone to a speaker.My Bluetooth headset had problems too.	2012-01-13	4
Keeping in touch	Has never been so much easier!!	2012-01-12	5
Family chats	We regularly Skype with our sons one of whom lives in Germany the other in USA	2012-01-12	5
elizabeth wellock	A wonderful experience talking to our daughter and family in South Africa, also to our grandaughter in Jersey all at the same time,The only drawback was when we had to sign-off and say farewell.	2012-01-11	4
Solid, but not implemented well enough	I enjoy using Skype, but it sometimes feels like it isn't integrated into my computer system well enough. It often feels like an outskirt of a program. However, it does provide easy free video calls or video and provides cheap calls from computer to mobile.	2012-01-10	5
Best way to stay in touch	"Since moving overseas, Skype has been the key to staying in touch with family and friends stateside.  I love that I can use it as a substitute for text messaging (huge savings there!), on my phone like it's a normal phone call, or on the computer to see everyone ""in person.""  Such a lifesaver!"	2012-01-10	5
changed how we speak	being in various countries in a month i can't survive without skype's voip service.!	2012-01-10	5
SKYPE	I am very satisfied with the service. Now I can talk to the dear people and friends around the world, very convenient - for free. Super.	2012-01-08	4
Brilliant but...	...now and again there are connection issues, but I think Skype is a wonderful service and has revolutionized my ability to function personally and professionally as I live and work overseas.	2012-01-08	4
Not good for international calling	I found this company good for video to video chat. However when I tried to use Skype credit to make international calls I unfortunately discovered how expensive they are! Also the quality is terrible! Needless to say, good for free video but bad for international communication	2012-01-06	2
9.9	I use Skype as my main means of communications as I do not have a landline,I am extremely happy with the services and the charges.Thanks-Skype Team,Keep Up the great work!	2012-01-05	5
Our Marriage depends on Skype.	WithTraveling overseas the best and lest cost effective way is to use SKYPE to phone each other and family.  I have spent hundreds of pounds/Dollars over the years.  But it would have been thousands if it were not for SKYPE.We have bad connections sometimes but that due the location and counties I’m staying in.We can see each other besides talking.  Thank You SKYPE and keep up the good workEddie(adroiteddie)	2012-01-03	5
The BEST  of the web for commucation and webcam	Love the setup and its so much fun....sometimes servers are a problem, but overall its a great service    Kudo's	2011-12-31	5
Getting rather complicated	I long for the days when Skype had a simple user interface. Now it's trying to be another Facebook. It's a phone book dammit!	2011-12-30	3

Great free communication app!	Use it to keep in contact with loved ones. Hope it stays free!	2011-12-18	5
Innovative but no longer the best	As a long time user and paid subscriber to Skype, I have been somewhat annoyed with their customer service. On a few occasions recently I have tried to use the feedback or compliants form and almost in all cases it crashed. My biggest gripw is that it is no longer the cheapest service (by some margin) and there are several others that are stepping into the arena. I will be trying them soon.	2011-12-17	3
Good service	Had problems topping up, but service is very good and great cheap way to speak to friends	2011-12-16	4
Why do thy always change the way skype works.	If the product works, why try and change it and piss people off from using it. Just leave it alone.	2011-12-16	3
family catch up	love this service to speak to my overseas family and can meet all my nieces and nephews	2011-12-12	5

good sevice	exelent service	2011-11-26	5
Each update crashes even more!	I used to marvel at skypes stability and dependability. Now, each time it updates it becomes even less stable.	2011-11-26	3
Don't give them your payment information	My account was hacked, Skype allowed £50 of my money to be taken from my credit card, and then they just said they wouldn't refund any of it.They seem happy to profit from crime.	2011-11-22	1
Awesome but has its hicups	Skype does everything it says it will do but not always smoothly.	2011-11-22	4
Truly amazing	Its amazing that we can speak to people across the globe for no or very minimal cost. Love it personally as it helps keeps in touch effectively.	2011-11-21	4
Great communication tool	Have used Skype with Family and friends in the USA, Japan, Oz and other parts of the uk. Brilliant way of staying in touch.	2011-11-20	4
Almost perfect	They need to upgrade the MAC version. I feel the PC version has better programing. Ex. on a PC you can snap pics of the people you chat with while on the MAC version u dont even have that option	2011-11-19	4
old system	there is better message systems than this.. writing works fine	2011-11-18	3
Can't Live without it	From calling home from Overseas to VOIP with gaming friends Skype has carved out a spot in everyday life.	2011-11-18	5
A Hub in the Sky for cheap call	A great way to save telephone cost. You can talk to your friends for free from Skype to Skype. What a revolutionised way to call cheaply.	2011-11-17	5

SKYPE ROCKS	SKYP IS REALLY EASY TO USE AND GREAT FOR ALL COMMUNICATIONS INCLUDING CALLS TEXTS AND IM'S I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE	2011-11-15	5
Bring us Together	"I first discovered Skype about 4 years ago and signed up when line rental cost more than my phonecalls! Skype has allowed me to see my family from the other side of the world, show them round my new house, introduce the ""grandchild"" - our Malamute and take part in a Christmas Eve tradition I would have otherwise missed.The services offered, the quality of the connections and the fact that mostly it's free is awesome!Thanks for getting us together Skype - nice one!"	2011-11-15	5

Very impressed	Been using Skype for a couple of months and have been much more impressed than I expected to be	2011-11-07	5
Up and Down	I don't know what it is with this service but since Microsoft took over it has been consistently on the decline. i have more dropped calls than ever before and sometimes the service just doesn't connect. i use skype for business calls and it makes me look bad when i keep dropping clients and associates in mid call.	2011-11-07	3
Very good	Only problem is working iout the time zones in which my colleagues function.	2011-11-01	4
fantastic	the best one	2011-11-01	5
so-so	hopefully thing will improve with MS onboard!	2011-10-31	3
Awesome!	I use this site very regularly to talk t my friends at home. I have been travelling for 9 months and this service has saved me from missing my family and friends too much. I love that I can see them while we talk.	2011-10-30	5
Frequent problems with calling	Usually I need to call twice to get a good connection - that's a pity	2011-10-29	4
Regular User	Apart from the odd distortions I am happy using Skype and haven't come across any other service that offers the amount of variety that Skype does.	2011-10-27	4
Probably good, but...	Not so easy to setup, and to use...	2011-10-23	3
excellent	excellent site to talk around with family and friends	2011-10-21	5
Used be great, now has multiple problems	Skype used to be fantastic now that Microdoft have bought it they keep changing and altering it, adding things taking other things out.It constantly spins at the side not delivering your messages, VIdeo is terrible quality now.I'd Go to ooVoo If I were You!!	2011-10-17	2
SKYPE IT AND DUMP FB...	The better way to communicate...beter than FB that is!	2011-10-17	5

Brilliant way to communicate all over the world	I use skype mainly as im a mother who sits in at night rather bored and tired, so i log on and chat to my friend who is also at home with a kiddie and its a lovely way to chat face to face and not feel so alone. Only problem is background noise is awful at times, signal goes in and out but apart from that great	2011-09-24	4
What a service!	Could not communicate without Skype!	2011-09-23	5
No more fees	Best invention ever. No more paying £££s for calls abroad... I don't even know why people still use phones and calling cards to call abroad, I swear it's cheaper to just get internet access and a PC for whomever you're calling and just hooking up on Skype!	2011-09-22	5
What an easy service	I can't believe that i haven't used this for years. Not only is it free when you speak to others on it, but better still i can talk to my computer and keep both hands free!	2011-09-16	4
Super	Super skype - my best tool - never take it away it is a great piece of technology - 5 stars	2011-09-15	5

Great service	If you have relatives abroad and you both own a pc then you should really consider using skype as you can call and talk for hours for free. Why pay for costly phone calls when you don't need to. Easy to download and set up and easy to use.	2011-07-13	5
Messenger and VOP	This software is the best around for instant messenging with video and voice capability - fast and reliable for file sharing and the best is it's free for the basic service which works just as well as if you pay - there are lots of service available within skype once you joinWell worth a look - would recommend it to anyone	2011-06-05	5

Atleast if they were going to do a chit like this they shouldnt have blocked the old good versions. Its like microsoft wants everyone to kill themselves over the chit quality of skype.	2019-05-06	1
I've been using skype since 2008	I've been using skype since 2008. It was a great program. But these new updates just suck. Lags, Interface, horrible to use.	2019-04-28	1
Account debacle	Logging into Skype has turned into a real debacle. The incompetent MS team has created the perfect trap for the elderly user. The trap is set by something as innocent (and very frequent for the elderly) as forgetting your own password. This is used by Skype as an opportunity to suggest to the user to create a MS account with which to log into Skype. After the unsuspected user agrees, the trap closes in. His entire history and friends list in his old account are rendered inaccessible. Moreover, even years later when the user tries to log into to the old account, his current account is rendered inaccessible. Skype gets into an infinite loops saying that the user account or password are incorrect. This happens even after the user changes the password of his current account through sms authentication. This entire thing us cursed. Avoid!	2019-04-27	1

Skype is the WORST product you hate to…	Skype is the WORST product you hate to LOVE. If it weren't for the constant forced updates, the shifting of the buttons and everything else, it would be horrible. I receive at least 10 spam calls every single day! It's the best part about it really. Then one time, I tried to delete my skype phone number. That was great. I couldn't, and even more, I can't even keep people from calling me! Talk about customer satisfaction. Imagine. This is the most technical company on the planet (Microsoft) and we can't delete a number immediately. And people think we went to the moon!!  HAHAHAHA.	2019-04-15	5
Skype is just so bad now a the hands of MS.	"Why oh why every time I go to use Skype do I have to re-learn its interface because of yet another ""clever"" idea.  Used to be so simple to use, now Microsoft have their hands on it, its just infuriating to work with."	2019-04-15	1
Ruined Skype with new forced update	Skype Classic was a perfect, simple to use tool. Now Microsoft is forcing an update that removed key features and has now become an electron app that is unacceptable. Microsoft also ignores everyone's request to bring back the original classic and now forces people to use their terrible new version. Shame what has happened to Skype.	2019-04-13	1
sucks	sucks.  Logs out all the time.	2019-04-10	1
No longer a useful tool	Used to be a light, functional and useful little assistant for work and family - MS has ignored its seasoned user base requests for a version of Classic to be available to those who want it and proceed to force features, privacy invasions and updates.  I will be putting in as much energy in encouraging my contacts to switch to any other app as i once put into promoting Skype until and unless MS provides a reasonable version.. if you want to know what that entails then look at V7 and previous.	2019-04-05	1
It is truly sad to see what has…	It is truly sad to see what has happened to skype since Microsoft acquired it.  Years ago there were some connection quality issues caused by very variable data-connection-quality (not skype's fault). Now there is just a merry-go-round of patches and up(down?)grades with each release becoming less good than it's predecessor. At the moment I cannot get any notification of receiving messages and my calls randomly drop out - only reestablishing 70% of the time. My contacts' status indications are rarely accurate. Despite having a 28-50Mb connection.Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves. I am now going to have to move to WhatsApp - which I have resisted for a couple of years, but now my 'experience has been improved' in Skype to the point that I give in.	2019-04-04	1

Atleast if they were going to do a chit like this they shouldnt have blocked the old good versions. Its like microsoft wants everyone to kill themselves over the chit quality of skype.	2019-05-06	1

Account debacle	Logging into Skype has turned into a real debacle. The incompetent MS team has created the perfect trap for the elderly user. The trap is set by something as innocent (and very frequent for the elderly) as forgetting your own password. This is used by Skype as an opportunity to suggest to the user to create a MS account with which to log into Skype. After the unsuspected user agrees, the trap closes in. His entire history and friends list in his old account are rendered inaccessible. Moreover, even years later when the user tries to log into to the old account, his current account is rendered inaccessible. Skype gets into an infinite loops saying that the user account or password are incorrect. This happens even after the user changes the password of his current account through sms authentication. This entire thing us cursed. Avoid!	2019-04-27	1

Skype is the WORST product you hate to…	Skype is the WORST product you hate to LOVE. If it weren't for the constant forced updates, the shifting of the buttons and everything else, it would be horrible. I receive at least 10 spam calls every single day! It's the best part about it really. Then one time, I tried to delete my skype phone number. That was great. I couldn't, and even more, I can't even keep people from calling me! Talk about customer satisfaction. Imagine. This is the most technical company on the planet (Microsoft) and we can't delete a number immediately. And people think we went to the moon!!

Skype is just so bad now a the hands of MS.	"Why oh why every time I go to use Skype do I have to re-learn its interface because of yet another ""clever"" idea.  Used to be so simple to use, now Microsoft have their hands on it, its just infuriating to work with."	2019-04-15	1
Ruined Skype with new forced update	Skype Classic was a perfect, simple to use tool. Now Microsoft is forcing an update that removed key features and has now become an electron app that is unacceptable. Microsoft also ignores everyone's request to bring back the original classic and now forces people to use their terrible new version. Shame what has happened to Skype.	2019-04-13	1
sucks	sucks.  Logs out all the time.	2019-04-10	1
No longer a useful tool	Used to be a light, functional and useful little assistant for work and family - MS has ignored its seasoned user base requests for a version of Classic to be available to those who want it and proceed to force features, privacy invasions and updates.  I will be putting in as much energy in encouraging my contacts to switch to any other app as i once put into promoting Skype until and unless MS provides a reasonable version.. if you want to know what that entails then look at V7 and previous.	2019-04-05	1
It is truly sad to see what has…	It is truly sad to see what has happened to skype since Microsoft acquired it.  Years ago there were some connection quality issues caused by very variable data-connection-quality (not skype's fault). Now there is just a merry-go-round of patches and up(down?)grades with each release becoming less good than it's predecessor. At the moment I cannot get any notification of receiving messages and my calls randomly drop out - only reestablishing 70% of the time. My contacts' status indications are rarely accurate. Despite having a 28-50Mb connection.Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves. I am now going to have to move to WhatsApp - which I have resisted for a couple of years, but now my 'experience has been improved' in Skype to the point that I give in.	2019-04-04	1

Skippy barked. But the password does not. Skippy Farted. So this is called a circle of hell. There are no more humans at microsoft so I am not prepared to spend another hour on useless forums. Bye bye Skippy. You are dust	2019-04-19	1

A shadow of it's former self	Skype has just gone downhill after being bought by Microsoft, the new UI is pretty terrible and constantly shifting arround the buttons is just annoying. Still, it gets the job done when you need to call someone.	2019-04-17	3
Skype is the WORST product you hate to…	Skype is the WORST product you hate to LOVE. If it weren't for the constant forced updates, the shifting of the buttons and everything else, it would be horrible. I receive at least 10 spam calls every single day! It's the best part about it really. Then one time, I tried to delete my skype phone number. That was great. I couldn't, and even more, I can't even keep people from calling me! Talk about customer satisfaction. Imagine. This is the most technical company on the planet (Microsoft) and we can't delete a number immediately. And people think we went to the moon!!  HAHAHAHA.	2019-04-15	5
Skype is just so bad now a the hands of MS.	"Why oh why every time I go to use Skype do I have to re-learn its interface because of yet another ""clever"" idea.  Used to be so simple to use, now Microsoft have their hands on it, its just infuriating to work with."	2019-04-15	1
Ruined Skype with new forced update	Skype Classic was a perfect, simple to use tool. Now Microsoft is forcing an update that removed key features and has now become an electron app that is unacceptable. Microsoft also ignores everyone's request to bring back the original classic and now forces people to use their terrible new version. Shame what has happened to Skype.	2019-04-13	1
sucks	sucks.  Logs out all the time.	2019-04-10	1
No longer a useful tool	Used to be a light, functional and useful little assistant for work and family - MS has ignored its seasoned user base requests for a version of Classic to be available to those who want it and proceed to force features, privacy invasions and updates.  I will be putting in as much energy in encouraging my contacts to switch to any other app as i once put into promoting Skype until and unless MS provides a reasonable version.. if you want to know what that entails then look at V7 and previous.	2019-04-05	1
It is truly sad to see what has…	It is truly sad to see what has happened to skype since Microsoft acquired it.  Years ago there were some connection quality issues caused by very variable data-connection-quality (not skype's fault). Now there is just a merry-go-round of patches and up(down?)grades with each release becoming less good than it's predecessor. At the moment I cannot get any notification of receiving messages and my calls randomly drop out - only reestablishing 70% of the time. My contacts' status indications are rarely accurate. Despite having a 28-50Mb connection.Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves. I am now going to have to move to WhatsApp - which I have resisted for a couple of years, but now my 'experience has been improved' in Skype to the point that I give in.	2019-04-04	1

Atleast if they were going to do a chit like this they shouldnt have blocked the old good versions. Its like microsoft wants everyone to kill themselves over the chit quality of skype.	2019-05-06	1

Account debacle	Logging into Skype has turned into a real debacle. The incompetent MS team has created the perfect trap for the elderly user. The trap is set by something as innocent (and very frequent for the elderly) as forgetting your own password. This is used by Skype as an opportunity to suggest to the user to create a MS account with which to log into Skype. After the unsuspected user agrees, the trap closes in. His entire history and friends list in his old account are rendered inaccessible. Moreover, even years later when the user tries to log into to the old account, his current account is rendered inaccessible. Skype gets into an infinite loops saying that the user account or password are incorrect. This happens even after the user changes the password of his current account through sms authentication. This entire thing us cursed. Avoid!	2019-04-27	1
