    "RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based approach grouping customers into segments. It groups the customers on the basis of their previous purchase transactions. How recently, how often, and how much did a customer buy. RFM filters customers into various groups for the purpose of better service. It helps managers to identify potential customers to do more profitable business.
