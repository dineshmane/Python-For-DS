					<b>Saudi ministry to employ women</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Women will be employed in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s foreign ministry for the first time this year, Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal has been reported as saying.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The move comes as the conservative country inches open the door to working women. Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de-facto ruler, told government departments to put plans in place for employing women. But progress has been slow, reports from the country say.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Earlier this week, the local Arab News said Labour Minister Ghazi al-Gosaibi had &quot;caused uproar&quot; when he said his ministry was having difficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices. The newspaper said many Saudi women found his explanation &quot;a pitiful excuse for not employing women&quot;. Women now make up more than half of all graduates from Saudi universities but only 5% of the workforce. &quot;Our educational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and professionally trained Saudi women who are acquiring their rightful position in Saudi society,&quot; Arab News quoted Prince Saud as saying. &quot;I am proud to mention here that this year we shall have women working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the first time.&quot;</p>
