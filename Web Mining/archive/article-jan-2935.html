		<h2>Card fraudsters &#x27;targeting web&#x27;</h2>
					<p>Card fraudsters &#x27;targeting web&#x27;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>New safeguards on credit and debit card payments in shops has led fraudsters to focus on internet and phone payments, an anti-fraud agency has said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Anti-fraud consultancy Retail Decisions says &#x27;card-not-present&#x27; fraud, where goods are paid for online or by phone, has risen since the start of 2005. The introduction of &#x27;chip and pin&#x27; cards has tightened security for transactions on the High Street. But the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack, Retail Decisions said.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The introduction of chip and pin cards aimed to cut down on credit card fraud in stores by asking shoppers to verify their identity with a confidential personal pin number, instead of a signature. Retail Decisions chief executive Carl Clump told the Online News that there was &quot;no doubt&quot; that chip and pin would &quot;reduce card fraud in the card-present environment&quot;. &quot;However, it is important to monitor what happens in the card-not-present environment as fraudsters will turn their attention to the internet, mail order, telephone order and interactive TV,&quot; he said. &quot;We have seen a 22% uplift in card-not-present fraud here in the UK... since the start of the year. &quot;Fraud doesn&#x27;t just disappear, it mutates to the next weakest link in the chain,&quot; he said.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Retail Decisions&#x27; survey on the implementation of chip and pin found that shoppers had adapted easily to the new system, but that banks&#x27; performance in distributing the new cards had been patchy, at best. &quot;The main issue is that not everyone has the pins they need,&quot; said Mr Clump. Nearly two thirds - 65% - of the 1,000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments. Of these, 83% were happy with the experience, though nearly a quarter said they struggled to remember their pin number. However, only 34% said they had received replacement cards with the necessary &#x27;chip&#x27; technology from all their card providers. Furthermore, 16% said that none of their cards had been replaced, while 30% said only some had. UK shoppers spent £5.3bn on plastic cards in 2003, the last full year for which figures are available from the Association of Payment Clearing Services (Apacs). Altogether, card scams on UK-issued cards totalled £402.4m in 2003. Card-not-present fraud rose an annual 6% to £116.4m, making it the biggest category even then. Within this, internet fraud totalled £43m, Apacs&#x27; figures show.</p>
