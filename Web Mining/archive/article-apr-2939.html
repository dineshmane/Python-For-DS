		<h2>Bates seals takeover</h2>
					<b>Bates seals takeover</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ken Bates has completed his takeover of Leeds United.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 73-year-old former Chelsea chairman sealed the deal at 0227 GMT on Friday, and has bought a 50% stake in the club. He said: &quot;I&#x27;m delighted to be stepping up to the mantel at such a fantastic club. I recognise Leeds as a great club that has fallen on hard times. &quot;We have a lot of hard work ahead to get the club back where it belongs in the Premiership, and with the help of our fans we will do everything we can.&quot; Bates bought his stake under the guise of a Geneva-based company known as The Forward Sports Fund. He revealed that part of his plan is to buy back Leeds&#x27; Elland Road stadium and Thorp Arch training ground in due course.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;It&#x27;s going to be a tough jon and the first task is to stabilise the cash flow and sort out the remaining creditors,&quot; Bates added. &quot;But there is light at the end of a very long tunnel. For the past year it has been a matter of firefighting - now we can start running the club again.&quot; Outgoing Leeds chairman Gerald Krasner said: &quot;This deal ensures the medium to long term survival of the club and I believe Mr Bates&#x27; proposals are totally for the benefit of the club. &quot;We are content that under Mr Bates, Leeds United will continue to consolidate and move forward. &quot;When we took over Leeds United in March 2004, the club had a debt of £103m, since that date, my board has succeeded in reducing the debt to under £25m. &quot;We worked tirelessly to solve all of the problems at Leeds United. &quot;Eighty percent of the problems have already been overcome and we came to this agreement with Mr Bates to secure its ongoing success.&quot; Krasner revealed that his consortium has been asked to remain in the background at the club for an undisclosed period to help ensure a smooth hand-over. He will stay on in an unpaid capacity while Peter Lorimer will continue in his role as director and point of contact for the fans and Peter McCormick will serve as a consultant to the incoming board. The other outgoing directors have agreed to leave their loans of £4.5m in the company for the next four years. On Leeds&#x27; new-look board it is understood that Lorimer will be joined by former Chelsea finance director Yvonne Todd and Bates&#x27; lawyer Mark Taylor.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Krasner refused to give any details of the finances involved in the takeover. He told Online News Five Live: &quot;I am not going into the figures. If Ken wants to give them up that is up to him. I can not tell you what the money will be used for. &quot;This dea l is not about money for the current board. In the last four months I never saw any cheques until this week from one person. I am not stretching figures, we don&#x27;t discuss internal arrangements.&quot; Bates stepped down as Chelsea chairman in March last year following Roman Abramovich&#x27;s £140m takeover at Stamford Bridge. In May, he made a proposal to invest £10m in Sheffield Wednesday, but this was rejected by the club. Sebastien Sainsbury had been close to a takeover of Leeds but withdrew his £25m offer last week.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>His efforts failed after he revealed it would take £40m to stage a takeover, and that the club will also lose £10m over the next six months. The club was on the brink of administration - and the deduction of 10 points by the Football League - before Bates&#x27; arrival but his investment has spared them that prospect.</p>
