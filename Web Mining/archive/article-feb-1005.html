					<b>O&#x27;Gara revels in Ireland victory</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ireland fly-half Ronan O&#x27;Gara hailed his side&#x27;s 19-13 victory over <i>England</i> as a &quot;special&quot; win.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Munster number 10 kicked a total of 14 points, including two drop goals, to help keep alive their Grand Slam hopes. He told Online News Sport: &quot;We made hard work of it but it&#x27;s still special to beat England. &quot;I had three chances to win the game but didn&#x27;t. We have work to do after this but we never take a victory over <i>England</i> lightly.&quot; Ireland hooker Shane Byrne echoed O&#x27;Gara&#x27;s comments but admitted the game had been England&#x27;s best outing in the Six Nations. Byrne said: &quot;It was a really, really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really, really hard. &quot;We just had to stick to our defensive pattern, trust ourselves and trust those around us. All round it was fantastic.&quot; Ireland captain Brian O&#x27;Driscoll, who scored his side&#x27;s only try, said: &quot;We are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with <i>England</i> also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter. &quot;We did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you&#x27;ve just got to jump on the back of it.&quot;</p>

			<span></span>
			<p>Ireland coach Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan was surprised that <i>England</i> coach Andy Robinson said he was certain Mark Cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break. &quot;Andy was sitting two yards from me and I couldn&#x27;t see whether he was offside or not so I don&#x27;t know how Andy could have known,&quot; said O&#x27;Sullivan.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;What I do know is that <i>England</i> played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us. &quot;We had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team. &quot;I think our try was very well worked, it was a gem, as good a try as we have scored for a while.&quot; O&#x27;Sullivan also rejected Robinson&#x27;s contention <i>England</i> dominated the forward play. &quot;I think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so I don&#x27;t know how that adds up to domination,&quot; he said. O&#x27;Driscoll also insisted Ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the Six Nations title. &quot;This season for the first time we have been able to play with the favourites&#x27; tag,&quot; he said. &quot;Hopefully we have proved that today and can continue to keep doing so. &quot;As for my try it was a move we had worked on all week. There was a bit of magic from Geordan Murphy and it was a great break from Denis Hickie.&quot;</p>
