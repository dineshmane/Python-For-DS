		<h2>Jol joy at &#x27;professional&#x27; Cup win</h2>
					<p>Jol joy at &#x27;professional&#x27; Cup win</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Tottenham manager Martin Jol acclaimed his players for their patience in their 3-0 FA Cup fifth-round victory over a determined Nottingham Forest side.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;We had the initiative but it wasn&#x27;t easy. It was a professional sort of performance,&quot; the Dutchman said. &quot;Forest played with a lot of players behind the ball in the first half, but at 2-0 they were dead and buried.&quot; Looking ahead to the quarter-final, Jol said: &quot;Newcastle have got a very good side and they are always difficult.&quot; However, he added that his side, who are four places above the Magpies in the Premiership, were &quot;not afraid of anyone&quot;. Robbie Keane, skipper for the night and scorer of the crucial second goal, echoed his manager&#x27;s sentiments on the last-eight match. &quot;They&#x27;re on a high, but we&#x27;re confident and in the last few games we&#x27;ve played well and hopefully we can go there and get the win,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>He conceded the win over Forest, which included goals from Noe Pamarot and Mido, was not pretty to watch. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t the best display but it&#x27;s all about the result,&quot; the Irishman said. &quot;We knew it was going to be difficult with the conditions. The pitch wasn&#x27;t the best but we still tried to pass it. &quot;We dug in and the gaffer said to us at half-time to keep being patient and that the goal will come.&quot; Forest manager Gary Megson conceded his team did not deserve anything after a poor performance. &quot;If you play like we did and concede two goals from corners you&#x27;re going to have an uphill battle against a very good team,&quot; he said. &quot;If we defend in the Championship like we did we&#x27;ll not get another point. &quot;We were organised but I felt at times we thought the system would be enough but we didn&#x27;t look like scoring.&quot;</p>
