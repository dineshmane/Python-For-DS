			<p>Republic of <i>Ireland</i> manager Brian Kerr admitted he was frustrated his side did not score more than one goal in their friendly win over Croatia.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Robbie Keane took his Republic record to 24 with a first-half goal which proved enough for victory. &quot;We had more good chances. It is just a shame we did not take them against such a technically gifted team,&quot; said Kerr. &quot;But, given the conditions and the standard of the Croatian team, we should be very happy with the win.&quot; The Republic side kept a clean sheet for the eighth time in 11 matches and are unbeaten in 14 home games since Kerr succeeded Mick McCarthy. Kerr applauded the decisive move which earned the victory. &quot;It was a brilliant goal, fantastic skill by Damien Duff. Robbie might have scuffed it a little but it was a good goal.&quot; Matchwinner Keane was another full of praise for Duff&#x27;s role in the goal. &quot;It was great play from Damien,&quot; said the Tottenham striker.</p>

			<p>&quot;I always try to be sniffing around because you know nine times out of 10 Duffer is going to get it in the box. &quot;Playing three up was something different. Brian Kerr wanted to try it out and it was good to see young Stephen Elliott getting a run-out. &quot;The conditions were difficult but he did well and is definitely one for the future. It is nice to see young players coming through.&quot; Man-of-the-match Duff explained what went wrong when he fluffed a chance to make it 2-0 midway through the second half. He opted to bring Steve Finnan&#x27;s cross down and shoot against the bar when a close-range header looked the best option. &quot;I would have headed that every time but I completely lost it in the lights,&quot; said the Chelsea star. &quot;I was desperate to get on the scoresheet myself but the result is the important thing. &quot;We have had a good year and are going nicely in the qualifiers. Hopefully that can continue in 2005.&quot;</p>
