		<h2>Executive trio leave Aer Lingus</h2>
					<p>Executive trio leave Aer Lingus</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Three senior executives of Ireland&#x27;s state-owned airline, Aer Lingus, are set to leave early on 28 January after accusations of a conflict of interest.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The trio are chief executive Willie Walsh, chief financial officer Brian Dunne and chief operations officer Seamus Kearney. The three have refused to confirm reports they plan to launch a private airline in competition with Aer Lingus. They announced in November they would quit in May, but did not give a reason. That decision had followed an announcement by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern - who is still considering the future of the airline - which ruled out a proposed management buy-out of Aer Lingus. Mr Walsh denied they had been forced out early because of the reports claiming they were set to launch a competitor airline.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;What I do after I leave Aer Lingus is still too early to say,&quot; Mr Walsh told AP news agency on Wednesday. &quot;I have opportunities open to me. Brian and Seamus are in the equally fortunate position.&quot; He said he had received more than 40 business proposals, mostly aviation-related, since the trio announced their resignations two months ago. Mr Walsh said there was no conflict of interest, and, if he was to launch a rival airline or join an existing competitor, &quot;this thing happens in every business&quot;. &quot;There&#x27;s absolutely no question of a conflict of interest. I&#x27;ve been completely focused on my responsibilities at Aer Lingus,&quot; he told AP.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>This week opposition politicians had called on the Irish government to make an urgent decision on the future of the airline. On Wednesday Irish Transport Minister Martin Cullen said in a statement: &quot;A conflict of interest cannot, should not and will not be allowed to arise between their current roles at Aer Lingus and their future career intentions.&quot; Last Friday the minister had announced he was to advertise for three senior executives for Aer Lingus. Mr Walsh, who took charge in 2000, and his team have earned praise for turning Aer Lingus around, by cutting air fares and staff, and re-positioning it as a low-fare airline to rival Ryanair. The company is 85% owned by the government and 15% by its staff.</p>
