					<p>Campbell lifts lid on United feud</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Arsenal&#x27;s Sol Campbell has called the rivalry between Manchester United and the Gunners &quot;bitter and personal&quot;.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Past encounters have stirred up plenty of ill-feeling between the sides and they meet again at Highbury on Tuesday. &quot;It is just more bitter and personal against United,&quot; the defender told The Online News newspaper. &quot;There&#x27;s an edge. &quot;After all that has happened, if we beat them it will be one of our sweetest ever wins, especially because of how we lost to them up there.&quot; Last October, Arsenal lost 2-0 at Old Trafford, which ended a record 49-match unbeaten league run and sparked a mini-crisis, with the Gunners winning only three of their next 10 games.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;It had a psychological impact on us, but again because of the way we were defeated,&quot; added the 30-year-old, referring to a controversial penalty award for United&#x27;s first goal. &quot;That was far more upsetting, losing like that, because they just seem to get away with it. You try and balance out over the course of a season but I&#x27;ve had so many rough decisions against them you begin to wonder.&quot; With tensions spilling over afterwards - United boss Sir Alex Ferguson was allegedly pelted with pizza in the players&#x27; tunnel - there is little surprise that so much is riding on the return encounter on. &quot;Everyone at Arsenal has been waiting for this game,&quot; said Campbell. &quot;We are up for this one.&quot;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Speaking on his long-term plans, Campbell signalled his intent to move abroad before he turns 35. &quot;I&#x27;m 30 now and in five years&#x27; time I won&#x27;t be in this country - that&#x27;s definite. &quot;Italy looks good to me because it would suit my kind of football. Spain is an option but the idea of tasting a new culture and learning another language excites me the most. I&#x27;m starting a little with French, of course.&quot;</p>
