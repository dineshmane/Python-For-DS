		<h2>Barkley fit for match in Ireland</h2>
					<b>Barkley fit for match in Ireland</b><br><br>
			<p></p>

			<p>England centre Olly Barkley has been passed fit for Sunday&#x27;s Six Nations clash with <i>Ireland</i> at Lansdowne Road.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Barkley withdrew from Bath&#x27;s team for Friday&#x27;s clash with Gloucester after suffering a calf injury in training. Gloucester centre Henry Paul has also been cleared to play after overcoming an ankle injury. <i>England</i> coach Andy Robinson, who names his team on Wednesday, has called up Bath prop Duncan Bell following Phil Vickery&#x27;s broken arm. With Vickery sidelined for at least six weeks and Julian White out with a neck injury, Bell could make his <i>England</i> debut. Bell, 30, had set his sights on an international career with Wales. But last December, the International Rugby Board confirmed that he could only be eligible for <i>England</i> as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. &quot;I thought I&#x27;d burned all my bridges with <i>England</i> when I expressed an interest in wanting to play for Wales, so it&#x27;s fantastic to get this opportunity,&quot; he said. Bell, who featured in the <i>England</i> A side which beat France 30-20 10 days ago, added: &quot;I recognise that I got into the <i>England</i> A squad because of injuries. &quot;And it&#x27;s the same again in getting into the senior squad. But now that I have this opportunity I intend to take it fully if selected and play my heart out for my country.&quot;</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>England coach Andy Robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan into his front row. But Sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped Bell - who was among the try-scorers when <i>England</i> A beat France A 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in.</p>
