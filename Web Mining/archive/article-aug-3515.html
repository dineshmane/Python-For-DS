					<b>$1m payoff for former Shell boss</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Shell is to pay $1m (£522,000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in April 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Judy Boynton finally left the firm on 31 December, having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive Jeroen van der Veer. In January 2004, Shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought. Shell said the pay-off was in line with Ms Boynton&#x27;s contract. She was leaving &quot;by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities&quot;, the firm said in a statement. The severance package means she keeps long-term share options, but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The revelation that Shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman, Sir Phil Watts, and production chief Walter van der Vijver.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>An investigation commissioned by Shell found that Ms Boynton had to share responsibility for the company&#x27;s behaviour. Despite receiving an email from Mr Van de Vijver which said the firm had &quot;fooled&quot; the market about its reserves, the investigation said, she did nothing to inquire further. In all, Shell restated its reserves four times during 2003. In September, it paid £82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the Atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves.</p>
