					<p>Umaga ready for &quot;fearsome&quot; Lions</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>All Blacks captain Tama Umaga has warned the British and Irish Lions will be his most fearsome opponents yet ahead of their summer tour.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But Umaga, in <i>England</i> for Saturday&#x27;s IRB Rugby Aid match, also backed New Zealand to win the three-Test series against the Lions. He told Online News Sport: &quot;It&#x27;s potentially the most fearsome line-up I&#x27;ve ever come up against. They&#x27;re awesome. &quot;But I&#x27;d back us all the way to beat them when they come over.&quot; Lions boss Sir Clive Woodward is set to announce his squad for the June-July tour next month.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>When Woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former <i>England</i> players. But Umaga said: &quot;He&#x27;d be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the Six Nations. &quot;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, <i>England</i> have got a lot of talented guys and I&#x27;m sure there are some of them who&#x27;ll make the Lions Test XV. &quot;But you can&#x27;t disguise <i>Wales</i> and Ireland in particular. Some of the tries they&#x27;ve scored have been great. I&#x27;ll admit it&#x27;ll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of Brian O&#x27;Driscoll.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Umaga will meet O&#x27;Driscoll in Saturday&#x27;s Rugby Aid match at Twickenham, with the Irish captain leading the Northern Hemisphere side. O&#x27;Driscoll is among a host of players in the Northern Hemisphere squad, coached by Woodward, that are tipped for Lions call-ups. &quot;It&#x27;ll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and June,&quot; Umaga said. The 31-year-old admitted interest in the Lions tour was immense, calling it &quot;the biggest thing to hit New Zealand since Lord of the Rings&quot;. He added: &quot;As players, it&#x27;s enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the Lions. In fact, it&#x27;s not just us All Blacks - it&#x27;s the talk of the country.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Umaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of Saturday&#x27;s charity game, which features a host of big names including George Gregan, Andrew Mehrtens and Chris Latham. But he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over. &quot;The second [Southern Hemisphere coach] Rod Macqueen made the approach, I didn&#x27;t hesitate. It was great when New Zealand Rugby then gave me the all clear. &quot;Thankfully I didn&#x27;t know anyone that was involved in the tragedy of the tsunami but you couldn&#x27;t miss all the horrific reports on the news. &quot;There are so many people that were affected, are still affected and will be affected for a long time. It&#x27;s just good to know we can do something minor to help out.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>- The match will be televised on Online News One at 1400 GMT on Saturday.</p>
