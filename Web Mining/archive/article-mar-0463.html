		<h2>Singapore growth at 8.1% in 2004</h2>
					<b>Singapore growth at 8.1% in 2004</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Singapore&#x27;s economy grew by 8.1% in 2004, its best performance since 2000, figures from the trade ministry show.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The advance, the second-fastest in Asia after China, was led by growth of 13.1% in the key manufacturing sector. However, a slower-than-expected fourth quarter points to more modest growth for the trade-driven economy in 2005 as global technology demand falls back. Slowdowns in the US and China could hit electronics exports, while the tsunami disaster may effect the service sector.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Economic growth is set to halve in Singapore this year to between 3% and 5%. In the fourth quarter, the city state&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annual rate of 2.4%. That was up from the third quarter, when it fell 3.0%, but was well below analyst forecasts. &quot;I am surprised at the weak fourth quarter number. The main drag came from electronics,&quot; said Lian Chia Liang, economist at JP Morgan Chase. Singapore&#x27;s economy had contracted over the summer, weighed down by soaring oil prices. The economy&#x27;s poor performance in the July to September period followed four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth as Singapore bounced back strongly from the effects of the deadly Sars virus in 2003.</p>
