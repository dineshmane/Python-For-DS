					<p>Sluggish economy hits German jobs</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The number of people out of work in Europe&#x27;s largest economy has risen for the tenth straight month as growth remains stubbornly slow.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>German unemployment rose 7,000 in November to 4.464 million people, or 10.8% of the workforce. The seasonally adjusted rise showed a smaller rise than expected, as government measures to encourage job creation began to take effect. But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market. &quot;There are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand,&quot; said Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Agency, in a statement. &quot;But growth of 0.1%... in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market.&quot; High oil prices and the soaring euro - which damages the competitiveness of exporters - were also having a negative effect, he said. The brunt of the unemployment is still being felt in the eastern part of Germany, where the rate is 18.8%.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>With unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda. A controversial package of measures to shake up incentives to get back to work, paid for by cutting some cherished benefits, has sparked anger among some German workers. Strikes in a number of industries, notably among the country&#x27;s iconic carmakers, have demonstrated the displeasure - as well as fears about further job losses as outsourcing takes hold. Among the new initiatives are the so-called &quot;one-euro jobs&quot; which top up unemployment benefit. The scheme&#x27;s formal launch is January, but hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting the unemployment statistics, economists said. &quot;The deterioration of the labour market does not come as a surprise,&quot; said Isabelle Kronawitter at Hypovereinsbank. &quot;Job creation measures probably prevented a stronger increase in the seasonally adjusted numbers.&quot;</p>
