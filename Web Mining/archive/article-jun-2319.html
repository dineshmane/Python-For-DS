					<p>Orange colour clash set for court</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A row over the colour orange could hit the courts after mobile phone giant Orange launched action against a new mobile venture from Easyjet&#x27;s founder.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Orange said it was starting proceedings against the Easymobile service for trademark infringement. Easymobile uses Easygroup&#x27;s orange branding. Founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou has pledged to contest the action. The move comes after the two sides failed to come to an agreement after six months of talks. Orange claims the new low-cost mobile service has infringed its rights regarding the use of the colour orange and could confuse customers - known as &quot;passing off&quot;.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Our brand, and the rights associated with it are extremely important to us,&quot; Orange said in a statement. &quot;In the absence of any firm commitment from Easy, we have been left with no choice but to start an action for trademark infringement and passing off.&quot; However, Mr Haji-Ioannou, who plans to launch Easymobile next month, vowed to fight back, saying: &quot;We have nothing to be afraid of in this court case. &quot;It is our right to use our own corporate colour for which we have become famous during the last 10 years.&quot; The Easyjet founder also said he planned to add a disclaimer to the Easygroup website to ensure customers are aware the Easymobile brand has no connection to Orange. The new service is the latest venture from Easygroup, which includes a chain of internet cafes, budget car rentals and an intercity bus service. Easymobile will allow customers to go online to order SIM cards and airtime - which will be rented from T-Mobile - for their existing handsets.</p>
