					<p>Iran jails blogger for 14 years</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>An Iranian weblogger has been jailed for 14 years on charges of spying and aiding foreign counter-revolutionaries.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Arash Sigarchi was arrested last month after using his blog to criticise the arrest of other online journalists. Mr Sigarchi, who also edits a newspaper in northern Iran, was sentenced by a revolutionary court in the Gilan area. His sentence, criticised by human rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders, comes a day after an online &quot;day of action&quot; to secure his release. Iranian authorities have recently clamped down on the growing popularity of weblogs, restricting access to major blogging sites from within Iran. A second Iranian blogger, Motjaba Saminejad, who also used his website to report on bloggers&#x27; arrests, is still being held.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>A spokesman for Reporters Without Borders, which tracks press freedom across the globe, described Mr Sigarchi&#x27;s sentence as &quot;harsh&quot; and called on Iranian President Mohammed Khatami to work to secure his immediate release. &quot;The authorities are trying to make an example of him,&quot; the organisation said in a statement.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;By handing down this harsh sentence against a weblogger, their aim is to dissuade journalists and internet-users from expressing themselves online or contacting foreign media.&quot; In the days before his arrest Mr Sigarchi gave interviews to the Online News Persian Service and the US-funded Radio Farda. Iranian authorities have arrested about 20 online journalists during the current crackdown. They accused Mr Sigarchi of a string of crimes against Iranian state, including espionage, insulting the founder of Iran&#x27;s Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, and current Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Mr Sigarchi&#x27;s lawyer labelled the revolutionary court &quot;illegal and incompetent&quot; and called for a retrial in a public court.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mr Sigarchi was sentenced one day after an online campaign highlighted his case in a day of action in defence of bloggers around the world.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Committee to Protect Bloggers designated 22 February 2005 as Free Mojtaba and Arash Day. Around 10,000 people visited the campaign&#x27;s website during the day. About 12% of users were based in Iran, the campaign&#x27;s director told the Online News News website. Curt Hopkins said Mr Sigarchi&#x27;s sentence would not dent the resolve of bloggers joining the campaign to help highlight the case. &quot;The eyes of 8 million bloggers are going to be more focused on Iran since Sigarchi&#x27;s sentence, not less. &quot;The mullahs won&#x27;t be able to make a move without it be spread across the blogosphere.&quot;</p>
