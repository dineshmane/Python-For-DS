					<b>Game firm holds &#x27;cast&#x27; auditions</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Video game firm Bioware is to hold open auditions for people to become cast members for future games.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The company, which makes role playing games such as Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, is seeking people aged 18 to 99. The Canada-based company says it was looking for &quot;a wide variety of people to use as face models for characters&quot;. Everyone chosen to appear in a video game will receive a performer&#x27;s fee for the use of their image. The company is inviting people to come along to a shopping mall in West Edmonton, Alberta, on Friday and Saturday, bringing along a piece of photo identification.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;There are hundreds and hundreds of characters in a typical Bioware game,&quot; said Shauna Perry, Bioware&#x27;s audio and external resources producer. &quot;Those people live in any city and village and so we need ordinary people, people with interesting faces.&quot; She added: &quot;Not everyone is a model in the world so we don&#x27;t want just models in our games.&quot; People chosen to appear in a game will have their head scanned in three dimensions. Hundreds of photos of the person&#x27;s head are taken so that a model of the head can be generated in 3D. &quot;The 3D model will look exactly like the person - it&#x27;s really quite incredible how detailed they are,&quot; said Ms Perry. She said chosen participants will have no control over how the image is used in a computer game. &quot;We cannot give people any control over how the images are used. &quot;But their face could be used in multiple games - so they could be the hero in one, the villain in another and just a merchant in a third.&quot;</p>
