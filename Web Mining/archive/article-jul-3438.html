					<b>Roche &#x27;turns down Federer offer&#x27;</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Australian tennis coach Tony Roche has turned down an approach from Roger Federer to be the world number one&#x27;s new full-time coach, say reports.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Melbourne&#x27;s Herald-Sun said Roche, troubled by a hip complaint, did not want to travel full-time again. However, Roche is happy to work with the Swiss star on a casual basis and is helping him prepare for next month&#x27;s defence of his Australian Open crown. Federer has been without a coach since splitting with Peter Lundgren in 2003. Roche, a former Davis Cup player for Australia, won the French Open, reached the Wimbledon and US Open finals and won five Wimbledon doubles titles with John Newcombe.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>He also coached former number one Ivan Lendl and Pat Rafter to Grand Slam victories and has worked with Australia&#x27;s Lleyton Hewitt. Some reports claim Federer initially wanted Andre Agassi&#x27;s Australian coach Darren Cahill, before Agassi confirmed he would play on in 2005. Federer was named Swiss sportsman of the year on Saturday, to add to the Online News overseas sportsman and European Sports Journalists Association awards he has already won.</p>
