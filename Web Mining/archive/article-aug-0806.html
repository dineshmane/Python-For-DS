					<b>Banker loses sexism claim</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>A former executive at the London offices of Merrill Lynch has lost her £7.5m ($14.6m) sex discrimination case against the US investment bank.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>An employment tribunal dismissed Stephanie Villalba&#x27;s allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay. But the 42-year-old won her claim of unfair dismissal, resulting from her sacking in August 2003. Her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about £55,000, a tiny fraction of what she asked for. The extent of damages will be assessed in the New Year. The action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the UK - had been viewed as something of a test case.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The tribunal decided that Ms Villalba had been unfairly dismissed because, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill&#x27;s private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as &quot;very disappointing&quot;, but pointed to some criticism of Merrill&#x27;s procedures within the lengthy judgement. The tribunal upheld Ms Villalba&#x27;s claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of &quot;laddish culture&quot; at the bank. &quot;We said from the start that this case was about performance not gender,&quot; Merrill said in a statement. &quot;Ms Villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman. &quot;Merrill Lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Based in London&#x27;s financial district, Ms Villalba worked for Merrill&#x27;s global private client business in Europe, investing funds for some of Merrill&#x27;s most important customers. But in 2003 her employers told her she had no future after 17 years with the company, and she was made redundant. Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba&#x27;s claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent. The firm had told the tribunal that Ms Villalba&#x27;s division had been losing about $1m a week. Merrill said Ms Villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.</p>
