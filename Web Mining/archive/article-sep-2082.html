					<b>Spain coach faces racism inquiry</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Spain&#x27;s Football Federation has initiated disciplinary action against national coach Luis Aragones over racist comments about Thierry Henry.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>If found guilty Aragones could lose his job or face a fine of about Â£22,000. The federation had initially declined to take action against Aragones after comments he made during a national team training session in October. But its president Angel Maria Villar changed his mind after a request by Spain&#x27;s anti-violence commission. Aragones insisted the comments, made to Henry&#x27;s Arsenal club-mate Jose Antonio Reyes, were meant to motivate the player, and were not intended to be offensive.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I never intended to offend anyone, and for that reason I have a very easy conscience,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;I&#x27;m obliged to motivate my players to get the best results. &quot;As part of that job, I use colloquial language, with which we can all understand each other within the framework of the football world. &quot; England&#x27;s players made a point of wearing anti-racism t-shirts when training before their friendly against Spain in Madrid last month.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>But the storm increased following racist chanting by Spanish fans at England&#x27;s black players during the game, which Spain won 1-0. Spain&#x27;s minister of sport Jaime Lissavetzky was quick to give his backing to the Federation&#x27;s decision. &quot;Everyone who has a public function has to consider their declarations, and make sure they do not give a negative image,&quot; he said. &quot;We are going to have zero tolerance in questions of racism.&quot;</p>
