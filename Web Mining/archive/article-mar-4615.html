		<h2>Mirza shocks Kuznetsova</h2>
					<b>Mirza shocks Kuznetsova</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Sania Mirza continued her remarkable rise with victory over US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova at the Dubai Championships on Tuesday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 18-year-old Indian, who is already a huge star in her home country, won 6-4 6-2 in front of a delirious crowd. It was Mirza&#x27;s sixth straight victory following her first WTA tournament win in Hyderabad last month. Earlier, Daniela Hantuchova built on her improving form with a 7-6 6-2 win over sixth seed Alicia Molik. Mirza needed attention to an ankle injury after the second game against Kuznetsova.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>She quickly slipped 4-0 down but staged a dramatic comeback that thrilled the large Indian contingent in the crowd. &quot;I really didn&#x27;t expect that after my ankle turn,&quot; said Mirza. &quot;I played a great match and I think (the crowd) did it again. I knew that I had to play an all-round game and that&#x27;s what happened. &quot;I did everything well but I wasn&#x27;t missing the ball - I don&#x27;t know how that happened.&quot; Mirza plays Silvia Farina Elia or Jelena Jankovic next. Hantuchova has risen from 31 in the world at the turn of the year to number 22, having reached the quarter-finals and semi-finals at her last two events. &quot;It was such a tough first-round match and I am glad to come through,&quot; said Hantuchova. &quot;She was serving so well. I just decided to hang in there and keep fighting.&quot; The Slovakian will meet Elena Likhovtseva in the second round after the Russian struggled past Tunisian wild card Selima Sfar 2-6 6-2 7-6. Likhovtseva needed nine match points before seeing off Sfar, who got a point penalty for swearing in the third set. Seventh seed Nathalie Dechy and Elena Bovina were among other first-round winners on Tuesday.</p>
