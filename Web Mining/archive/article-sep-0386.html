		<h2>Chinese dam firm &#x27;defies Beijing&#x27;</h2>
					<b>Chinese dam firm &#x27;defies Beijing&#x27;</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>The China Three Gorges Project Corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the Chinese state press has said.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The builder of the Three Gorges Dam is continuing work on the sister Xiluodu dam, said the Beijing News. The Xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. The Beijing News said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. The firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the Three Gorges Underground Power Plant and the Three Gorges Project Electrical Power Supply Plant.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>So far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by China&#x27;s State Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order. The China Three Gorges Project Corp could now face a fine up to 200,000 yuan ($24,000; Â£12,700). Last week, it denied that its projects violated regulations. &quot;The Three Gorges Corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law,&quot; it said.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The Sepa order comes as the Chinese government appears to be trying to cool the country&#x27;s booming economy. Previously it has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages, which forced many factories into part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6% to 440,700 megawatts (MW). The Xiluodu Dam is designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity, and is being built on the Jinshajiang - or &quot;river of golden sand&quot; as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. It is a sister project to the main Three Gorges Dam downstream where more than half a million people have had to be relocated, drawing criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.</p>
