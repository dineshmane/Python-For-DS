		<h2>Fuming Robinson blasts officials</h2>
					<p>Fuming Robinson blasts officials</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>England coach Andy Robinson said he was &quot;livid&quot; after his side were denied two tries in Sunday&#x27;s 19-13 Six Nations loss to <i>Ireland</i> in Dublin.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Mark Cueto&#x27;s first-half effort was ruled out for offside before the referee spurned TV replays when <i>England</i> crashed over in the dying minutes. &quot;[I&#x27;m] absolutely spitting. I&#x27;m livid. There&#x27;s two tries we&#x27;ve been cost,&quot; Robinson told Online News Sport. &quot;We&#x27;ve got to go back to technology. I don&#x27;t know why we didn&#x27;t.&quot; South African referee Jonathan Kaplan ruled that Cueto was ahead of Charlie Hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the Sale wing to gather.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when Josh Lewsey took the ball over the Irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try. &quot;I think Mark Cueto scored a perfectly legal try and I think he should have gone to the video referee on Josh Lewsey,&quot; said Robinson. &quot;It is how we use the technology. It is there, and it should be used.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I am still trying to work out the Cueto try. I have looked at both, and they both looked tries. &quot;We are very disappointed, and this will hurt, there is no doubt about that. &quot;We are upset now, but the referee is in charge and he has called it his way and we have got to be able to cope with that.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;We did everything we could have done to win the game. I am very proud of my players and, with a couple of decisions, this could have been a very famous victory. &quot;I thought we dominated. Matt Stevens had an awesome game at tighthead prop, while the likes of Charlie Hodgson, Martin Corry and Lewis Moody all came through well. &quot;Josh Lewsey was awesome, and every one of the forwards stood up out there. Given the pressure we were under, credit must go to all the players. &quot;We have done everything but win a game of rugby, but <i>Ireland</i> are a good side. They defended magnificently and they&#x27;ve got every chance of winning this Six Nations.&quot; <i>England</i> have lost their first three matches in this year&#x27;s Six Nations and four out of their six games since Robinson took over from Sir Clive Woodward in September.</p>
