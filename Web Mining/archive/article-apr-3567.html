					<b>Yachvili savours France comeback</b><br><br>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>France scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili praised his team after they fought back to beat England 18-17 in the Six Nations clash at Twickenham.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Yachvili kicked all of France&#x27;s points as they staged a second-half revival. &quot;We didn&#x27;t play last week against Scotland and we didn&#x27;t play in the first half against England,&quot; he said. &quot;But we&#x27;re very proud to beat England at Twickenham. We were just defending in the first half and we said we had to put them under pressure. We did well.&quot; Yachvili admitted erratic kicking from England&#x27;s Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley, who missed six penalties and a drop goal chance between them, had been decisive. &quot;I know what it&#x27;s like with kicking. When you miss some it&#x27;s very hard mentally, but it went well for us,&quot; he said. France captain Fabien Pelous insisted his side never doubted they could secure their first win against England at Twickenham since 1997. France were 17-6 down at half-time, but Pelous said: &quot;No-one was down at half-time, we were still confident. &quot;We said we only had 11 points against us, which was not much. &quot;The plan was to keep hold of possession and pressure England to losing their composure.&quot; France coach Bernard Laporte accepted his side had not played well. &quot;We know we have to play better to defend the title,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m not happy we didn&#x27;t score a try but we&#x27;re happy because we won.&quot;</p>
