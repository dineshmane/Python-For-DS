			<p></p>
			<p>US retail giant Federated Department Stores is to buy rival May Department Stores for $11bn (Â£5.7bn).</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The deal will bring together famous stores like Macy&#x27;s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s and Marshall Field&#x27;s, creating the largest department store chain in the US. The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn. The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May&#x27;s chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January. As part of the deal, Federated - owner of Macy&#x27;s and Bloomingdale&#x27;s - will assume $6bn of May&#x27;s debt, bringing the deal&#x27;s total value to $17bn. Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.</p>

			<p></p>
			<p>May has struggled to compete against larger department store groups such as Federated and other retailers such as Wal-Mart. Federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;We have taken the first step toward combining two of the best department store companies in America, creating a new retail company with truly national scope and presence,&quot; said Terry Lundgren, Federated&#x27;s chairman. Some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for May. &quot;Without this deal May would have been, to put it bluntly, washed up,&quot; said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard&#x27;s Retail Consulting Group. Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn, while May&#x27;s yearly sales are $14.4bn.</p>
