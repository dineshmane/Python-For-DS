		<h2>Bush to outline &#x27;toughest&#x27; budget</h2>
					<b>Bush to outline &#x27;toughest&#x27; budget</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>President Bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the US Congress, seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>About 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a $2.5 trillion (Â£1.3 trillion) package aimed at curbing the giant US budget deficit. Defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in Iraq. Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the &quot;tightest&quot; so far.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>At the heart of the administration&#x27;s fifth budget, presented to Congress on Monday, is an austere package of domestic measures. These would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Such belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of President Bush&#x27;s first term. Mr Cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the Bush Presidency but argued it was &quot;fair and responsible&quot;. &quot;It is not something we have done with a meat axe, nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society,&quot; he said. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit. The shortfall is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Education, environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to $230bn by 2009.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Most controversially, the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget, which provides health care to the nation&#x27;s poorest, by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m. Spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase, although not by as much as originally planned. President Bush&#x27;s proposals would see the Pentagon&#x27;s budget rise by $19bn to $419.3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The budget does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration&#x27;s radical proposed overhaul of social security provision. Some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5bn trillion over a twenty year period. Despite the Republicans holding a majority in both houses of Congress, the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>John McCain, a Republican Senator, said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit. &quot;With the deficits that we are now running, I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget,&quot; he said. However, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009. &quot;The cost of everything he [President Bush] advocates explodes,&quot; he said.</p>
