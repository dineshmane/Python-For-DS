			<p></p>
			<p>British Telecom has said it will double the broadband speeds of most of its home and business customers.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The increased speeds will come at no extra charge and follows a similar move by internet service provider AOL. Many BT customers will now have download speeds of 2Mbps, although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month. The new speeds start to come into effect on 17 February for home customers and 1 April for businesses. &quot;Britain is now broadband Britain,&quot; said Duncan Ingram, BT&#x27;s managing director, broadband and internet services. He added: &quot;Ninety percent of our customers will see real increases in speed.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;These speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections,&quot; he said. Upload speeds - the speed at which information is sent from a PC via broadband - will remain at the same speed, said Mr Ingram. Despite the increases, BT will continue to have usage allowances for home customers. &quot;The allowances are extremely generous,&quot; said Mr Ingram &quot;For what we are seeing in the market place - they are really not an issue.&quot; BT will begin enforcing the allowances in the summer. Customers who exceed the amounts will either be able to pay for a bigger allowance or see their download speeds reduced. BT now has a 36% share of the broadband market - down from 39% - which is becoming increasingly competitive. In the last few months, many rival ISPs have begun to offer 2Mbps services, including AOL, Plusnet and UK Online.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But Britain continues to lag behind some countries - especially Japan and South Korea - which offer broadband speeds of up to 40Mbps. But Mr Ingram said it was important to &quot;separate hype from reality&quot;. He said that a limited number of people with those connections consistently received speeds of 40Mbps. Customers will not see their connections double immediately on 17 February. Mr Ingram said there would be a roll out across the network in order to prevent any problems.</p>
