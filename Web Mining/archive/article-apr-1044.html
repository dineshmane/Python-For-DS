					<p>Castaignede fires Laporte warning</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Former France fly-half Thomas Castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach Bernard Laporte following their defeat by Wales.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>France suffered a shock loss against the Welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win. Castaignede told Online News Sport: &quot;The pressure is big on Laporte after a huge loss to New Zealand, a slim win over <i>Scotland</i> and a miracle against England. &quot;But the French have to get behind him and the team at Lansdowne Road.&quot; Following victories over South Africa and Australia in November, France were deemed by many to be the world&#x27;s leading side. But they were then trounced 45-6 by New Zealand and only just beat <i>Scotland</i> after the Scots had a try disallowed in their Six Nations opener. It then took some woeful spot kicking from Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley to help them to victory against <i>England</i> at Twickenham. &amp;lt;</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Castaignede said: &quot;You can&#x27;t say any of those results have eased the pressure on Laporte. &quot;Had England&#x27;s kickers not been so bad, the position in the Six Nations would be very different now.&quot; Laporte has been criticised for France&#x27;s negative tactics in their wins over <i>Scotland</i> and England. But his side played a more free-flowing style against Wales, making a mockery of the opposition&#x27;s defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval. &quot;All the chat in France has been about how France will play against Ireland,&quot; said Castaignede ahead of the 12 March tie. &quot;Everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against Wales. But everyone also wants a win.&quot; Castaignede, a veteran of 43 international caps, admitted the French would go in as underdogs against Ireland.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Going to <i>Ireland</i> is never easy but the way they&#x27;re playing right now, it&#x27;s harder than ever,&quot; said Castaignede. &quot;They&#x27;re very experienced and don&#x27;t often lose at home. They&#x27;ve got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break.&quot; Despite praising the Irish he claimed the Welsh had the upper hand in the Six Nations run-in. &quot;Ireland have such a good pack but <i>Wales</i> are something else on the break,&quot; he added. &quot;At the weekend they were simply awesome. As a Frenchman it was disappointing to see, but you had to admire it. &quot;Their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship.&quot; The 30-year-old also tipped Yann Delaigue to start ahead of Frederic Michalak at number 10 after an impressive display in Paris last weekend. &quot;Delaigue played really well and admittedly Michalak played well too,&quot; said Castaignede. &quot;I&#x27;m just glad I&#x27;m not the one who has to make the decision.&quot;</p>
