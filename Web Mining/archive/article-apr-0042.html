					<b>Radcliffe yet to answer GB call</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Paula Radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the World Cross-Country Championships.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 31-year-old is concerned the event, which starts on 19 March in France, could upset her preparations for the London Marathon on 17 April. &quot;There is no question that Paula would be a huge asset to the GB team,&quot; said Zara Hyde Peters of UK Athletics. &quot;But she is working out whether she can accommodate the worlds without too much compromise in her marathon training.&quot; Radcliffe must make a decision by Tuesday - the deadline for team nominations. British team member Hayley Yelling said the team would understand if Radcliffe opted out of the event. &quot;It would be fantastic to have Paula in the team,&quot; said the European cross-country champion. &quot;But you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus. &quot;She is not messing us around. We all understand the problem.&quot; Radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year&#x27;s event because of injury. In her absence, the GB team won bronze in Brussels.</p>
