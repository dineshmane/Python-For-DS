					<b>Thomas out of Six Nations</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Wales captain Gareth Thomas has been ruled out of the rest of the Six Nations with a broken thumb.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The full-back will have surgery on Monday after fracturing his thumb in the 24-18 win over France on Saturday. But Welsh legend Phil Bennett insisted <i>Wales</i> can cope without Thomas as they chase a first Grand Slam in 27 years. Bennett told Online News Sport: &quot;Such is the spirit in the camp, they&#x27;ll put Kevin Morgan at 15, Rhys Williams at wing and just carry on.&quot; Thomas will miss the match against <i>Scotland</i> on 13 March, and what promises to be a huge encounter against the Irish six days later. Bennett added: &quot;It&#x27;s a setback. He&#x27;s a great captain, he leads from the front and the boys love him.&quot; Thomas was replaced at half-time by Williams as his side turned around a 15-6 deficit in Paris.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;With Gareth missing I would think Michael Owen will be our captain,&quot; said <i>Wales</i> coach Mike Ruddock. &quot;He did a great job in the second half in France. He has been vice-captain all along throughout the championship.&quot; <i>Wales</i> travel to Edinburgh to take on <i>Scotland</i> in a fortnight and then host <i>Ireland</i> in Cardiff in the final round of matches in what could be the Grand Slam and championship decider. Bennett, an inspirational fly-half for Llanelli and <i>Wales</i> in the 1970s, insisted the national team were entering a new golden period. &quot;It was a great game and a magnificent result for Wales,&quot; Bennett told Online News Radio Five Live&#x27;s Sportsweek programme.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>&quot;The way this young team are blending, the glory days are on their way back. &quot;We couldn&#x27;t get possession early on and France dominated and scored two tries. &quot;Had they been ruthless, <i>Wales</i> could have gone into the interval 30 points down. But they didn&#x27;t take their chances. &quot;Wales defended fairly well but you cannot give that sort of quality ball to good sides. &quot;The All Blacks would have been ruthless and buried us in the first half. But the character we showed in the second half was quite outstanding.&quot;</p>
