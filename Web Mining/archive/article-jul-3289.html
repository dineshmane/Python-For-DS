					<p>Ronaldinho denies Blues interest</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Fifa World Player of the Year Ronaldinho says he has no intention of leaving Barcelona to join Chelsea.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I never said I wanted to play for Chelsea. I&#x27;m very happy where I am and want to carry on where I am,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to be part of the history of Barcelona as a winning player. Barcelona has given more to me than I have to them.&quot; The Brazilian added: &quot;From the first day I have had lovely surprises. Barcelona, for me, is perfect.&quot; Ronaldinho&#x27;s words will reassure Barca after the Brazilian previously said he was interested in moving to England. He was quoted as saying: &quot;What Chelsea are doing is absolutely amazing. I respect them a lot and can see maybe see myself living in London one day.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Barca meet Chelsea in the last 16 of the Champions League and Ronaldinho is expecting a tough time against the London outfit. &quot;I hope we can reach the final of the Champions League, but it is a very strong competition,&quot; he said. &quot;Chelsea are one of the highest-ranking teams.&quot;</p>
