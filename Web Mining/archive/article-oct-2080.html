					<b>Rivals back anti-racism campaign</b><br><br>
			<span></span>

			<span></span>
			<p>Manchester United and Arsenal players will wear black and white wristbands when they face each other on Tuesday as part of a new anti-racism initiative.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Launching the &#x27;Stand Up, Speak Up&#x27; scheme with Thierry Henry, United&#x27;s Rio Ferdinand said football&#x27;s ruling bodies should do more to tackle racist abuse. &quot;If an offence is committed, they should make a stand against it before the players do,&quot; Ferdinand said. &quot;It should be up to the authorities to come forward.&quot; Ferdinand added: &quot;It is a massive issue that needs to be jumped on and addressed. &quot;It is a bit sad that it has taken the initiative of a player to push this issue forward.&quot; Henry became involved with the campaign following comments directed at him last year by Luis Aragones.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ferdinand claimed he was surprised by the lack of action taken against the Spain coach, saying: &quot;I think if it had been the <i>England</i> manager who had said something like that, he wouldn&#x27;t be in a job now.&quot;</p>
