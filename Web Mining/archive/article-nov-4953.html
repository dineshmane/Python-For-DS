					<p>Beckham rules out management move</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham has no plans to become a manager when his playing career is over.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I am not interested in being a coach but I would like to have football schools,&quot; the <i>England</i> captain said on television station Canal Plus. &quot;I have wanted to do that since I went to the Bobby Charlton school. I&#x27;m going to open one in London and one in LA. &quot;My second passion is charity work - I am an ambassador for Unicef and it gives me great pride.&quot; But Beckham revealed that his immediate priority was winning the Spanish league title with Real Madrid.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Real slipped to 13 points behind leaders Barcelona with a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Sevilla on Wednesday. Beckham admitted: &quot;It&#x27;s disappointing and frustrating to see the results, considering the team we have. &quot;I would really like to win La Liga with Real Madrid - I have been here two years and we still have not done it.&quot; In a wide-ranging interview, Beckham also revealed that his sending-off against Argentina - and the resulting media storm - had been the most significant moment in his career. Asked for his worst memory, he said: &quot;To be sent off against Argentina - it was not for the sending-off but for what happened afterwards. &quot;I was lucky because I had a manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who supported me and a strong family behind me but I believe that changed me. &quot;I believe it changed me for the better.&quot;</p>
