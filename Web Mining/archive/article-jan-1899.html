		<h2>Featured: &#x27;Friends fear&#x27; with lost mobiles</h2>
					<p>&#x27;Friends fear&#x27; with lost mobiles</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>People are becoming so dependent on their mobile phones that one in three are concerned that losing their phone would mean they lose their friends.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>More than 50% of mobile owners reported they had had their phone stolen or lost in the last three years. More than half (54%) of those asked in a poll for mobile firm Intervoice said that they do not have another address book. A fifth rely entirely on mobiles. About 80% of UK adults own at least one mobile, according to official figures. It is estimated that 53% of over 65s own a mobile, according to Intervoice, but the figures are higher for those aged between 15 and 34.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Most 15 to 24-year-olds (94%), and 25 to 34-year-olds (92%), own at least one. Nineteen percent of mobile owners were more concerned about how long it would take to find their contacts&#x27; information again if the phone was lost, stolen or replaced.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>The survey showed that extent to which people have become reliant on their phones as address book. Many mobile owners do not bother to make back-ups of their contact details, and with people changing their phones once a year on average, it becomes a problem. They also are becoming less likely to remember numbers by heart, relying on the mobile phone book instead. &quot;We&#x27;re a nation of lazy so-and-sos,&quot; David Noone from Intervoice said. &quot;We put the numbers in our phones so we can call a friend at the touch of just one or two buttons and we certainly can&#x27;t be bothered to write them down in an old fashioned address book. &quot;The mobile phone plays such a key role in modern relationships; take the phone away and the way we manage these relationships falls apart.&quot; One in three women, the survey said, thought if they lost their phones, it would mean they would lose touch with people altogether. Most (62%) said they had no idea what their partner&#x27;s number was. Mr Noone said it should be up to mobile operators to provide back-up services on the network itself, instead of relying on mobile owners to find ways themselves.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Generally, information from Sim cards can be backed up on physical memory cards, or can be copied onto computers via cables if the phone is a smartphone model with the right software. Sim back-up devices can be bought from phone shops for just a few pounds.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>But some operators offer customers free web-based back-up services too. Orange told the Online News News website that those with Orange Smartphones could use the My Phone syncing service which means back-ups of address books and other data are created online. For non-smartphone users, a Memory Mate card could be used to back up data on the phone. O2 also offers a free, web-based syncing service which works over GPRS and GSM. Neither Vodafone or T-Mobile currently offer a free network service for back-ups, but encourage people to use Sim back-up devices. It is thought that about 10,000 phones are lost or stolen every month and 50% of total street crime involves a mobile. Mobile phone sales are expected to continue growing over the next year. Globally, more than 167 million mobile phones were sold in the third quarter of 2004, 26% more than the previous year, according to analysts. It is predicted that there will be two billion handsets in use worldwide by the end of 2005.</p>
