					<p>Aviation firms eye booming India</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>India&#x27;s defence minister has opened the country&#x27;s Aero India 2005 air show with an invitation for global aerospace firms to outsource jobs to the nation.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Pranab Mukherjee said such companies could take advantage of India&#x27;s highly skilled workers and low wages. More than 240 civil and military aerospace firms from 31 countries are attending the show. Analysts said India could spend up to $35bn (Â£18.8bn) in the aviation market over the next 20 years. Giants such Boeing and Airbus - on the civil aviation front - as well as Lockheed Martin and France&#x27;s Snecma - on the military side - are some of the firms attending the show. &quot;There is tremendous scope for outsourcing from India in areas where the companies are competitive,&quot; said Mr Mukerjee. &quot;We are keen to welcome international collaborations that are in conformity with our national goals.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Lockheed said it had signed an agreement with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to share information on the P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>In fact, the Indian Armed Force is considering the buying of used P-3 Orion as well as F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed. The US military industry has show a strong interest to open a link with India, now that relations between the two countries have improved a lot. In fact, it is the first time the US Air Force will attend the air show since sanctions imposed in 1998 after India&#x27;s nuclear tests were lifted. But the Indian Air Force is also considering proposals from other foreign firms such as France&#x27;s Dassault Aviation, Sweden&#x27;s Saab and Russia&#x27;s Mikoyan-Gurevich. Meanwhile, France&#x27;s Snecma has also said it plans a joint venture with HAL to make engine parts, with an initial investment of $6.5m.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>On the civilian front, Boeing announced a deal with India&#x27;s HCL Technologies to develop a platform for the flight test system of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft. The US company also said it had agreed with a new Indian budget airline the sale of 10 737-800 planes for $630m. The airline, SpiceJet, will also have the option to acquire 10 more aircraft. Airbus has also recently signed fresh deals with two Indian airlines - Air Deccan and Kingfisher. In addition, the European company has plans to open a training centre in India. Meanwhile, flag carrier Air India is considering to buy 50 new aircraft from either Boeing or Airbus. &quot;No other market is going to see the growth that will be seen here in the coming years,&quot; said Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president Boeing.</p>
