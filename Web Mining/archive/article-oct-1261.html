					<p>Formula 1: US-Qatari investors &#x27;to bid for sport&#x27;</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The Miami Dolphins American football team owner Stephen Ross is working with investors from Qatar to buy a stake in Formula 1 racing.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mr Ross&#x27;s RSE Ventures, backed by Qatar Sports Investments, plan a bid for CVC Capital Partners&#x27; 35.5% controlling stake in the holding company that owns F1.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The deal could be worth up to $8bn, and help build F1&#x27;s presence in the US.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But negotiations are at an early stage, Online News sports editor Dan Roan says.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>And the group is just one of a number of potential bidders, he adds.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>No formal bid has been made yet and there is no guarantee that CVC would sell.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The move comes as Formula One racing grapples with falling viewing figures, controversial race rules and soaring costs, all of which have led to some teams struggling for sponsorship.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>RSE was founded by property billionaire Stephen Ross, whose company has been in talks with ex-England footballer David Beckham about bringing a Major League Soccer team to Miami.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>CVC, whose interests in F1 are looked after by Bernie Ecclestone, has been F1&#x27;s biggest shareholder for about a decade, although in the last few years it has reduced its stake.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>In 2012, CVC came close to floating the sport&#x27;s holding company on the Singapore stock market.</p>
