					<p>Australia rates at four year high</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country&#x27;s economy.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, their first upwards move in more than a year. However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The rate hike was the first since December 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance. However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The figures, representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in GDP seen between July and September, were below market expectations. Consumer spending remains strong, however, and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures. &quot;Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited,&quot; said Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>At 2.6%, inflation remains within the Bank&#x27;s 2-3% target range. However, exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in the country&#x27;s current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record Australian dollar 29.4bn. The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low. &quot;The economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn&#x27;t look to me like it&#x27;s slowing in any unreasonable way,&quot; said Treasurer Peter Costello. Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy. &quot;That 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1,&quot; said Michael Blythe, chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. &quot;This suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004.&quot;</p>
