					<b>Tate &amp; Lyle boss bags top award</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Tate &amp; Lyle&#x27;s chief executive has been named European Businessman of the Year by a leading business magazine.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Iain Ferguson was awarded the title by US publication Forbes for returning one of the UK&#x27;s &quot;venerable&quot; manufacturers to the country&#x27;s top 100 companies. The sugar group had been absent from the FTSE 100 for seven years until Mr Ferguson helped it return to growth. Tate&#x27;s shares have leapt 55% this year, boosted by firming sugar prices and sales of its artificial sweeteners.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;After years of a sagging stock price and a seven-year hiatus from the FTSE 100, one of Britain&#x27;s venerable manufacturers has returned to the vaunted index,&quot; Forbes said. Mr Ferguson took the helm at the company in 2003, after spending most of his career at consumer goods giant Unilever. Tate &amp; Lyle, which was an original member of the historic FT-30 index in 1935, operates more than 41 factories and 20 more additional production facilities in 28 countries. Previous winners of the Forbes award include Royal Bank of <i>Scotland</i> chief executive Fred Goodwin and former Vodafone boss Chris Gent.</p>
