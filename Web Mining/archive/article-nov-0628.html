					<p>Jones files Conte lawsuit</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Marion Jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Balco boss Victor Conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>The Sydney Olympic gold medallist says Conte damaged her reputation and she is seeking $25m (Â£13m) in the suit. Conte, whose company is at the centre of a doping investigation, made the claims in a US television programme. He and three others were indicted in February by a federal grand jury for a variety of alleged offences. In an email to the Associated Press on Wednesday, Conte said: &quot;I stand by everything I said&quot;. Jones won three gold medals and two bronzes in Sydney in 2000. Her lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in San Francisco, said the sprinter had passed a lie detector test and that she &quot;has never taken banned performance-enhancing drugs&quot;. Conte&#x27;s statements, the suit added, were &quot;false and malicious&quot;. After the ABC television program earlier this month, Jones&#x27; lawyer Richard Nicholls said: &quot;Marion has steadfastly maintained her position throughout: she has never, ever used performance-enhancing drugs. &quot;Victor Conte is a man facing a 42-count federal indictment, while Marion Jones is one of America&#x27;s most decorated female athletes. Mr Conte&#x27;s statements have been wildly contradictory. &quot;Mr Conte chose to make unsubstantiated allegations on television, while Marion Jones demanded to take and then passed a lie detector examination.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Mr Conte is simply not credible. We challenge him to submit to the same lie detector procedure that Marion Jones passed.&quot; The sport&#x27;s ruling body, the IAAF, is taking a cautious approach to Conte&#x27;s allegations but contacted the US Anti-Doping Agency. Communications director Nick Davies said the IAAF would seek to contact Conte &quot;for further information&quot;. But Davies stressed it would be up to the American authorities to decide whether they will take action against Jones in light of Conte&#x27;s television interview and the world governing body would monitor the situation closely. &quot;If it is felt there is case to answer, it would be for its national governing body (USA Track and Field) to take the appropriate disciplinary action,&quot; he added. &quot;The US Anti-Doping Agency has proved itself to be very diligent in its anti-doping war. &quot;And I am sure, like ourselves, they will be watching the television programme with great interest.&quot; Jones, who is under investigation for steroid use by the US Anti-Doping Agency, has continually denied ever taking illegal substances since being investigated in the Balco scandal, although she praised a zinc supplement Conte marketed. Jones, who did not win any medals in Athens in August, has never failed a drugs test. Meanwhile, Conte, who has been charged along with three other men of distributing illegal steroids and money laundering, is due to face trial in March.</p>
