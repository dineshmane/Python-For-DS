					<b>Irish duo could block Man Utd bid</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Irishmen JP McManus and John Magnier, who own a 29% stake in Manchester United, will reportedly reject any formal £800m offer for the club.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph say they will oppose any formal £800m takeover bid from US tycoon Malcom Glazer. Mr Glazer got permission to look at the club&#x27;s accounts last week. Irish billionaires Mr McManus and Mr Magnier are said to believe that an £800m bid undervalues club prospects.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mr Magnier and Mr McManus, who hold their stake through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle have the power to block a bid. Mr Glazer&#x27;s financial backers, including JP Morgan, the US investment bank have said they won&#x27;t back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75% of the club&#x27;s shares. However, there has been much speculation that the Irish duo simply do not think the price offered - 300p a share - is high enough. Mr Glazer has been stalking the premier league football club since 2003.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mr Magnier and Mr McManus issued a statement late on Friday saying that they remained &quot;long-term investors&quot; in Man Utd. The Sunday Telegraph says the board of Manchester United also considered a management buyout at just over 300p but did not go ahead with it.</p>
