					<p>O&#x27;Sullivan quick to hail Italians</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ireland coach Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan heaped praise on Italy after seeing his side stutter to a 28-17 victory in Rome.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;It was a hell of a tough game,&quot; said O&#x27;Sullivan. &quot;We struggled in the first half because we hadn&#x27;t the football. &quot;Italy played really well. They handled the ball well in terms of kicking it, if that&#x27;s not an oxymoron. &quot;We said before the game that it might take until 10 minutes from the end for this game to be won, and that&#x27;s how it turned out.&quot; Ireland struggled to cope with Italy&#x27;s fierce start and were indebted to skipper Brian O&#x27;Driscoll, who set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer. &quot;We had our first attack in the Italian half after 22 minutes,&quot; said O&#x27;Sullivan. &quot;We had a good return, with three first-half possessions in their half and we scored twice. &quot;The second half was about spending more time in their half.&quot; Scrum-half Peter Stringer was also glad that Ireland escaped wtih a victory. &quot;All credit to them,&quot; he told Online News Sport. &quot;We knew it would be tough coming to Rome. They always give us a tough game here and they showed a lot of spirit. &quot;They had a lot of ball in the first half but we got a few scores when we got into their 22.&quot;</p>
