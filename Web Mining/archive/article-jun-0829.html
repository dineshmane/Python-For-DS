					<b>SA unveils &#x27;more for all&#x27; budget</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>The South African government has put tax cuts and increased social spending at the centre of its latest budget.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Aiming to both stir economic growth and aid the country&#x27;s poor, finance minister Trevor Manuel said the focus of the 2005 budget was &quot;more for all&quot;. The tax cuts target firms and individuals, cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand ($1.2bn; Â£910m). Spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. Spending on housing and sanitation will rise by 12%. All the spending increases will run over the next three years.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Unveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament, Mr Manuel said the South African economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the African average of 4%.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>He predicted that the South African economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. Mr Manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008, helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. Given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;In this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of South Africa,&quot; said Mr Manuel. He said that the economic situation was a &quot;marked improvement&quot; on the position at the end of apartheid, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the lives and livelihoods of the disadvantaged. About 280,000 jobs a year have been created in South Africa since 2000 but unemployment remains high, currently close to 30%. Economist Colen Garrow said the budget looked as if it would stimulate economic growth. &quot;It&#x27;s pleasant to see the cut in company taxes, it&#x27;s a good incentive for business,&quot; he said.</p>
