			<p>UK retail sales were better than expected in November as Christmas shoppers began their seasonal flock to the High Street, figures show.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said retail sales rose 0.6% on the month and 6.1% on the year. But the figures, along with this week&#x27;s inflation report, could trigger another interest rate rise in the New Year. However, recent data from the British Retail Consortium showed a 0.2% slip in High Street sales during November.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>The ONS data confounded analyst expectations. Many had expected sales to fall slightly in November as shoppers put off buying Christmas presents until December. However, retailers&#x27; attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind November&#x27;s unexpected rise in sales, they say. Aggressive tactics, such as one-day discount sales adopted by stores such as Marks &amp; Spencer, appear to have paid off. &quot;Price discounting has certainly accounted for much of this because the value of retail sales hasn&#x27;t grown as much as volumes,&quot; said Investec economist David Page. The figures sparked a rally for sterling as the data supported the view that it is too early to assume that base rates have peaked.</p>
