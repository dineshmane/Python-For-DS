					<p>Brazil buy boosts Belgium&#x27;s Inbev</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Belgian brewing giant Inbev has seen its profits soar thanks to its acquisition of Brazil&#x27;s biggest beer firm Ambev last year.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Inbev, which makes Stella Artois, said pre-tax profits for 2004 rose 56% to 1.16bn euros ($1.5bn; Â£800m), and said it expected solid growth in 2005. The performance comes on sales up 21% at 8.6bn euros. The firm, formerly Interbrew, became the world&#x27;s biggest brewer by volume when it bought Ambev in August 2004. The acquisition meant its sales by volume grew 57% in 2004, with four months of Ambev sales accounting for almost all of the increase. US beermaker Anheuser-Busch sells less beer by volume than Inbev but is bigger in terms of the value of its sales. Continuing demand for Inbev&#x27;s products in the South American markets where its Brazilian arm is most popular means it expects to keep boosting its turnover. &quot;It&#x27;s the Brazil business that&#x27;s doing it,&quot; said ING analyst Gerard Rijk of Inbev&#x27;s strong performance. Ambev boosted its share of Brazil&#x27;s beer market from 62% at the end of 2003 to more than 68% by December 2004, Inbev reported. In contrast, Inbev&#x27;s European business saw volume sales fall 2.5%, although Central and Eastern European sales rose 12%. Overall, net profits were up 42% to 719m euros.</p>
