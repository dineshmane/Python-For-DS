		<h2>Wasps 31-37 Leicester</h2>
					<p>Wasps 31-37 Leicester</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Leicester withstood a stunning Wasps comeback to win a pulsating Heineken Cup encounter at the Causeway Stadium.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The Tigers stormed 22-6 ahead within 18 minutes through tries from Lewis Moody, Geordan Murphy and Martin Corry. European champions Wasps fought back through a Josh Lewsey try and Mark van Gisbergen&#x27;s boot, and they were level at 31-31 with five minutes remaining. But it was the visitors who kept their cool as Andy Goode kicked the Tigers to victory with a penalty and a drop goal. The closing moments saw desperate defence from Leicester as Wasps turned down several penalties to go for the try they needed. Wasps pounded the line and a penalty try looked likely before referee Nigel Williams controversially blew for full-time. Fly-half Goode was the Tigers hero, kicking 22 points in total, while Leicester&#x27;s overwhelming domination in the scrums ultimately told. Even their lack of discipline in defence - which presented the admirable Van Ginsberg with 26 points - could not undo them as they held out for a famous win.</p>

			<p>Lawrence Dallaglio&#x27;s team have now got it all to do in the quest for a quarter-final place given that two of their last three games are away - against Leicester and Biarritz. However, Wasps rugby director Warren Gatland warned his side will will not relinquish their European title without a fight. &quot;If we lose next week, then we are struggling,&quot; said Gatland. &quot;But we don&#x27;t want to give this trophy away. We worked so hard to win it last season, we will go down fighting. &quot;We have got to get our scrum right next week, it is the biggest cause for concern.&quot; Leicester coach John Wells saluted the outstanding work of Graham Rowntree and Julian White, who were magnificent up front. &quot;They were the backbone of our performance today,&quot; said Wells. &quot;And to score three tries against the European champions at home was also something I am pleased about.&quot;</p>
