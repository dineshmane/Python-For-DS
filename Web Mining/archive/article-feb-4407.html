					<p>Egypt to sell off state-owned bank</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Egyptian government is reportedly planning to privatise one of the country&#x27;s big public banks.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>An Investment Ministry official has told the Online News news agency that the Bank of Alexandria will be sold sometime in 2005. The move is seen as evidence of a new commitment by the government to reduce the size of public sector. The official said the government has not yet decided whether the sale will take the form of a public flotation. &quot;The most important thing to decide now is the method - whether by selling shares to the public or to a strategic investor from abroad,&quot; he said.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Analysts say the public-sector banks have suited the government&#x27;s monetary, credit and exchange policies. Nevertheless, the Egyptian government has spoken for years about privatising one of the big four state banks - Banque Misr, National Bank of Egypt, Banque du Caire and Bank of Alexandria. It had been expected one of the smallest of the four big public banks - Bank of Alexandria or Banque du Caire - would be sold first. The announcement reinforces the hopes of investors and international financial bodies for a revival of Egypt&#x27;s privatisation programme. About 190 state-run companies and facilities were sold off from the early 1990s to 1997. The appointment of Mahmoud Mohieldin, a reform-minded technocrat, to the new post of investment minister in July was taken as a sign that more sell-offs were on the way. Both the IMF and World Bank have urged Egypt to remove obstacles to the development of the private sector which they say has a vital role to play in reducing poverty by expanding the economy.</p>
