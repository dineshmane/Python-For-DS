					<p>Bad e-mail habits sustains spam</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The &#x27;bad behaviour&#x27; of e-mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry, a new study has found.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>According to a survey conducted by security firm Mirapoint and market research company the Radicati Group, nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. One in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. Clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business, especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little, the report concludes. &quot;This preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us,&quot; said Marcel Nienhuis, market analyst at the Radicati Group. &quot;It explains why e-mail security threats including spam, viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate,&quot; he said, accusing users of &quot;bad e-mail behaviour&quot;. Spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the month, according to security firm Clearswift. It has recently seen a rise in the number of spam messages offering phoney Sony PSP giveaways. And, in perhaps a nod to the popularity of the American drama series Desperate Housewives, it has also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking for casual sex. But rather than finding a companion, users who click on such mail will find themselves redirected to porn sites, where they run the risk of downloading spyware on to their PC. Clearswift has seen a 180% rise in sex-related spam over the course of the last month. &quot;Without casting aspersions, those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that &#x27;one thing leads to another&#x27; but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus, clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems,&quot; said Alyn Hockey, Clearswift&#x27;s director of research.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Sexually explicit terms make up 14% of security firm Sophos&#x27; top 50 word that spammers most commonly try to disguise in order to beat anti-spam filters. Spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by-pass anti-spam software, said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant for security firm Sophos. &quot;The list of words most commonly hidden by the spammers from anti-spam software reveals that most spam is about the old favourites: money, drugs and sex,&quot; said Mr Cluley. But anti-spam filters can only be part of the solution to the menace of junk e-mail. &quot;People must resist their basic instincts to buy from spam mails. Spammers are criminals, plain and simple. If no-one responded to junk e-mail and didn&#x27;t buy products sold in this way, then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs,&quot; he said.</p>
