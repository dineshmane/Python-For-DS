					<b>Bath faced with Tindall ultimatum</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Mike Tindall&#x27;s agent has warned Bath they have until next week to improve their contract offer to the <i>England</i> man or risk losing him to a rival club.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Dipo Alli says he has received an offer for Tindall which dwarfs Bath&#x27;s deal and that two other clubs want to talk. &quot;Mike does not want to go into the Six Nations worrying about where he will be playing his club rugby next season,&quot; Alli told the Online News newspaper. &quot;It is up to (Bath owner) Andrew Brownsword. He has to make it happen.&quot; Tindall is out of contract at the end of the season but it is understood that Brownsword is unwilling to break the club&#x27;s salary structure to accommodate the 26-year-old&#x27;s demands. But Alli insists the player is worth more than Bath have put on the table. &quot;Mike has been at Bath for eight years and wants to remain with the club and his demands are anything but excessive,&quot; the agent added. &quot;But Brownsword has to recognise Mike&#x27;s value and we want to resolve things by the end of next week.&quot;</p>
