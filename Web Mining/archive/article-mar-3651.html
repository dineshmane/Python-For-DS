					<p>Wales critical of clumsy Grewcock</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Wales coach Mike Ruddock says <i>England</i> lock Danny Grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked Dwayne Peel.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Trouble flared at a ruck in the first half of Wales&#x27; 11-9 win in Cardiff as Grewcock came recklessly over the top with his boot, leaving Peel bloodied. Grewcock was sin-binned with <i>Wales</i> captain Gareth Thomas for retaliation. &quot;It&#x27;s up to the citing commissioner,&quot; said Ruddock. &quot;I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s deliberate, but Grewcock did a similar thing for Bath against Leinster.&quot; Last June Grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against New Zealand.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Six years earlier, also in New Zealand, Grewcock became only the second <i>England</i> player to be sent off in Tests. The player himself and his captain Jason Robinson have both said that the clash with Peel was accidental. &quot;If the ball is at the back of the ruck and I feel I can step over and disrupt it then I will do that,&quot; said Grewcock. But Ruddock feels that the <i>England</i> man should be more careful. &quot;The boy himself should look at his actions, it was a clumsy piece of footwork,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#x27;s a great player and I don&#x27;t want to knock him, we won&#x27;t be calling for the match commissioner to review the incident. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to go too far with the lad. It could just be a clumsy action and Dwayne had just a minor cut. &quot;The referee&#x27;s interpretation was that Grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck.&quot; Ruddock also warned his RBS 6 Nations Championship rivals that his team can make massive improvements. &quot;We created more opportunities and also squandered them by taking more contact and playing more individually,&quot; said the coach. &quot;We&#x27;ve looked through things on the video debrief and there were definitely a lot of chances that we wasted.&quot; In the forthcoming games, Ruddock may use penalty hero Gavin Henson as his first-choice kicker in place of Stephen Jones. &quot;Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but it&#x27;s something we&#x27;ll talk about in selection this week,&quot; said Ruddock.</p>
