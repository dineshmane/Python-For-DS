					<b>Celtic make late bid for Bellamy</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Newcastle striker Craig Bellamy is discussing a possible short-term loan move to Celtic, Online News Sport understands.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Welsh striker has rejected a move to Birmingham after falling out with Magpies manager Graeme Souness. The Toon boss vowed Bellamy would not play again after a bitter row over his exclusion for the game against Arsenal. Celtic are in no position to match Birmingham&#x27;s Â£6m offer but a stay until the end of the season could suit Bellamy while he considers his future. According to Bellamy&#x27;s agent, the player dismissed a permanent move to Birmingham. And it is unlikely that Newcastle would allow the player to go on loan to another Premiership club.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Bellamy was fined two weeks&#x27; wages after a live TV interview in which he accused Souness of lying, following a very public dispute about what position Bellamy should play in the side. Souness said: &quot;He can&#x27;t play for me ever again. He has been a disruptive influence from the minute I walked into this football club. &quot;He can&#x27;t go on television and accuse me of telling lies.&quot; Chairman Freddy Shepherd described Bellamy&#x27;s behaviour as &quot;totally unacceptable and totally unprofessional&quot;.</p>
