					<p>Souness eyes summer move for Owen</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Newcastle boss Graeme Souness is lining up a summer move for England and Real Madrid striker Michael Owen.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>He sees Owen as the ideal replacement for Alan Shearer, who is due to retire in the summer, although he hopes to persuade Shearer to carry on. &quot;Michael is in the category of players who would excite the fans and we&#x27;re monitoring him,&quot; he told Online News Newcastle. &quot;He is a great centre-forward and only 25 but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re the only ones monitoring the situation at Real.&quot; Souness has also hinted he thinks Shearer may carry on despite his stated intent to retire at the end of the season. He believes the prospect of breaking Jackie Milburn&#x27;s club scoring record may influence the striker&#x27;s decision.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Milburn scored 200 league and cup goals between 1946 and 1957, while Shearer currently has 187 goals to his name. &quot;Without giving too much away, I am confident he will be here next season,&quot; said Souness. &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine him leaving without breaking Jackie Milburn&#x27;s scoring record.&quot; Souness also revealed he tried to bring back Nolberto Solano during the January transfer window. The Peruvian international was sold to Aston Villa a year ago but in the phone-in for Online News Newcastle, Souness said tried to re-sign him, but Villa were not interested in selling.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The former Rangers and Liverpool boss is also looking to bring in a number of new acquisitions once the current campaign has been completed. &quot;I&#x27;m after three, four or five new players in the summer - we have got lots of targets,&quot; he said. &quot;Don&#x27;t think we will wait to the last day of the season to say: `Who are we going to target now?&quot;&#x27;</p>
