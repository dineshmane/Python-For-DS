					<b>Player burn-out worries Robinson</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>England coach Andy Robinson says English rugby has to act now to prevent injury destroying players&#x27; careers.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>He will be without a host of big names for the Six Nations as the intensity of professional rugby union hits players. &quot;Injuries are part of the sport but we have to have a look at the amount of injuries that occur in the English season,&quot; Robinson told Online News Sport. &quot;I think players are probably going to have three or four years taken off their careers.&quot; Robinson will be missing an entire midfield for the Six Nations with the likes of Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Will Greenwood injured.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Rugby union has become far more physically demanding since the game went professional nearly 10 years ago. As a result three of the major stakeholders in English rugby have launched an &quot;injury audit&quot; to find out how players are coping. The audit is jointly funded by the Professional Rugby Players&#x27; Association, the Rugby Football Union and Premier Rugby. As far as Robinson is concerned its findings must not be ignored. &quot;I think there&#x27;s an injury audit coming out in March that&#x27;s got some great information in there that I think everybody in the English game has got to look at,&quot; he said. &quot;If we don&#x27;t the situation is going to get worse and not better, so I think rugby as a whole has got to look at this.&quot;</p>
