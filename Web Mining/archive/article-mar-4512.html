					<p>Minister hits out at Yukos sale</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Russia&#x27;s renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed, a senior government figure has warned.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Economy minister German Gref told the Kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was &quot;unjustified&quot;. His comments follow the sale of much of oil giant Yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm&#x27;s assets into public ownership. On 28 December, another senior economic adviser called the sale &quot;the swindle of the century&quot;. Yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60% of Yukos&#x27; output, had been seized and sold in December for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called Baikal.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm Rosneft, itself shortly to merge with state gas giant Gazprom. &quot;We used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing,&quot; Andrei Illarionov - then economic adviser to President Vladimir Putin - told a press conference. &quot;Now officials are doing it.&quot; Within days, he was stripped of most of his responsibilities.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Mr Gref, a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market, was keen to distance himself from Mr Iliaronov&#x27;s comments. The privatisation of companies such as Yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said. But he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil. &quot;I think that Rosneft and Yuganskneftegaz, should it become a state-owned company, must be privatized,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Today our government is ineffective and state companies, as a result, are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well.&quot; And he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like Yukos - a technique now being applied by the Kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. &quot;If we follow that logic, we should nationalise all businesses,&quot; he said. Many large Russian companies, particularly in the energy sector, use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Mr Gref also poured cold water on President Putin&#x27;s promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. The assault on Yukos&#x27; assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months. &quot;The task is not simply to double GDP; instead it is to use GDP to qualitatively improve people&#x27;s lives,&quot; Mr Gref told Kommersant. &quot;We don&#x27;t need simply to increase GDP, but to improve its structure.&quot; Instead of focusing on headline growth figures, Russia needed to focus on better institutions, such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.</p>
