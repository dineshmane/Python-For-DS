		<h2>Cannabis hopes for drug firm</h2>
					<b>Cannabis hopes for drug firm</b><br><br>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>A prescription cannabis drug made by UK biotech firm GW Pharmaceuticals is set to be approved in Canada.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The drug is used to treat the central nervous system and alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). A few weeks ago, shares in GW Pharma lost a third of their value after UK regulators said they wanted more evidence about the drug&#x27;s benefits. But now Canadian authorities have said the Sativex drug will be considered for approval.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Approximately 50,000 people in Canada have been diagnosed with MS and 85,000 people are suffering from the condition in the UK. Many patients already smoke cannabis to relieve their symptoms.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Now, GW Pharma&#x27;s Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Final approval in Canada should now be little more than a formality, analysts said, and the company expects full approval for Sativex early in 2005. &quot;We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005,&quot; said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. Satifex consists of a cannabis extract containing tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol, a cocktail that has also proved effective in treating patients with arthritis. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. Despite hopes of regulatory approval last year, a series of delays has put back Sativex&#x27;s launch in the UK. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.</p>
