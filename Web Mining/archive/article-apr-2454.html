			<p>Bolton boss Sam Allardyce has signed Roma defender Vincent Candela on a five-month deal.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 31-year-old former France international gave his last press conference as a Roma player on Monday, anouncing his move to Bolton. &quot;I have signed a five-month contract with Bolton,&quot; said Candela, who will travel to England on Tuesday. &quot;In June I will decide whether to continue to play for Bolton or retire from professional football.&quot; Allardyce hopes Candela&#x27;s arrival will relieve Bolton&#x27;s injury crisis after defender Nicky Hunt limped out injured during Oldham&#x27;s 1-0 win against Oldham in the FA Cup on Sunday. &quot;In light of what has happened to Nicky Hunt, with his injury, it might be a blessing in disguise that we can bring in a highly-experienced full-back to help with our injuries at the back,&quot; Allardyce said. &quot;He has an outstanding pedigree in the game and has won honours at the highest level including the World Cup in 1998. &quot;He has not played regular football this year but is eager to impress in the Premiership. &quot;He can play in any position at the back and despite him being predominately right-footed he has played the majority of his career at left-back.&quot; Candela, who was a member of the Roma side that won the title in 2001, has made only seven league appearances this season for Luigi del Neri&#x27;s side.</p>
