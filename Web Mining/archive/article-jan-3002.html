					<p>Moya suffers shock loss</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Fifth seed Carlos Moya was the first big name to fall at the Australian Open as he went down to fellow Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez on Monday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Moya began the year with victory at the Chennai Open but looked out of sorts from the start in the Melbourne heat. Garcia-Lopez, ranked 106 in the world, dominated from the outset and withstood a third-set rally from Moya to hang on for a 7-5 6-3 3-6 6-3 victory. The 21-year-old plays Kevin Kim or Lee Hyuung-Taik in the second round. Garcia-Lopez was delighted with the victory in only his third ever Grand Slam match. &quot;I think this was the most important win of my life as Carlos is one of the best players in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;This has given me a lot of confidence. Now I feel I can beat all these players.&quot; Moya said: &quot;I was playing well before I came here. It was the perfect preparation but something was wrong today.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Four-time champion Andre Agassi began what could be his last Australian Open with a convincing win over German qualifier Dieter Kindlmann. The 34-year-old American, who had been struggling with a hip injury earlier in the week, stormed to a 6-4 6-3 6-0 win. Agassi will play France&#x27;s Olivier Patience or Germany&#x27;s Rainer Schuettler - the man he beat in the 2003 final - in the next round. &quot;No one was more concerned (about the injury) than myself,&quot; said eighth seed Agassi. &quot;I&#x27;d worked hard to be down here and ready. But the last few days, I&#x27;ve pushed through the injury and it seemed to do pretty good.&quot; In other matches, world junior champion Gael Monfils made use of his wild card with a magnificent 1-6 6-3 6-4 7-6 (8-6) win over American Robby Ginepri. The 2002 champion Thomas Johansson fought back to beat Peter Luczak 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 6-3 4-6 6-0, and French Open champion Gaston Gaudio beat Justin Gimelstob 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 6-3. Seeds Dominik Hrbaty, Ivan Ljubicic and Mario Ancic made comfortable progress, but former French Open champion Albert Costa lost to Bjorn Phau.</p>
