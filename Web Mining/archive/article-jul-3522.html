					<b>Tindall aiming to earn Lions spot</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Bath and <i>England</i> centre Mike Tindall believes he can make this summer&#x27;s Lions tour, despite missing most of the season through injury.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The World Cup winner has been out of action since December, having damaged both his shoulder and his foot. But Tindall, who recently signed for Bath&#x27;s west-country rivals Gloucester, told Rugby Special he would be fit in time for the tour to New Zealand. &quot;I&#x27;m aiming to be fit by 18 April and hope I can play from then,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;ve spoken to Sir Clive Woodward and he understands the situation, so I just hope that I can get on the tour.&quot; The 26-year-old will face stiff competition for those centre places from Brian O&#x27;Driscoll, Gordon D&#x27;Arcy and Gavin Henson, and is aware that competition is intense.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>But after missing out on the 2001 tour to Australia with a knee injury, Tindall says he will be happy just to have an opportunity to wear the red shirt. &quot;I&#x27;m quite laid back about it to be honest - it&#x27;s quite hard for me to expect to be pushing for a Test spot,&quot; he said. &quot;But after what&#x27;s happened this season at least Clive knows I&#x27;ll be 100% fresh!&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>- For the full interview with Mike Tindall tune into this Sunday&#x27;s Rugby Special, 2340 on Online News Two</p>
