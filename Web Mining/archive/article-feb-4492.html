					<p>BP surges ahead on high oil price</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Oil giant BP has announced a 26% rise in annual profits to $16.2bn (£8.7bn) on the back of record oil prices.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Last week, rival Shell reported an annual profit of $17.5bn - a record profit for a UK-listed company. BP added that it was increasing its fourth-quarter dividend by 26% to 8.5 cents, and that it would continue with share buybacks. BP chief executive Lord Browne said the results were strong &quot;both operationally and financially.&quot;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The company is earning about $1.8m an hour.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Despite the record annual profits figure, BP&#x27;s performance was below the expectations of some City analysts. However, BP&#x27;s share price rose 4p or nearly 1% in morning trading to 548p. Its profit rise for the year included profits of $3.65bn (£1.97bn) for the final three months of 2004 - up from $2.89bn a year ago but below its third quarter.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Speaking on the Online News&#x27;s Today programme on Tuesday, Lord Browne said the profits were not solely down to the high oil price alone.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;The profits are up more than the price of oil is up,&quot; he said. Lord Browne pointed out that BP was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration. &quot;We have spent many years buying (assets) when the price is low,&quot; he said. The company has made new discoveries in Egypt, the Gulf of Mexico and Angola.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>However, Lord Browne rejected calls for a windfall tax on his company&#x27;s huge profits, saying that in the North Sea it paid progressively more tax, the more profits it made. Lord Browne believes oil prices will remain quite high. Currently above $40 a barrel, he said: &quot;The price of oil will be well supported above $30 a barrel for the medium term.&quot; BP put production for the year at 3.997 billion barrels of oil, up 10% on 2003, but slightly lower than the four billion barrels it had initially aimed for.</p>
