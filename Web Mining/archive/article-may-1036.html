		<h2>Ireland call up uncapped Campbell</h2>
					<b>Ireland call up uncapped Campbell</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Ulster scrum-half Kieran Campbell is one of five uncapped players included in Ireland&#x27;s RBS Six Nations squad.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Campbell is joined by Ulster colleagues Roger Wilson and Ronan McCormack along with Connacht&#x27;s Bernard Jackman and Munster&#x27;s Shaun Payne. Gordon D&#x27;Arcy is back after injury while Munster flanker Alan Quinlan also returns to international consideration. &quot;The squad is selected purely on form. A lot of players put their hands up,&quot; coach Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan told Online News Sport. &quot;Kieran Campbell was just one of those players. He has been playing very well in the Heineken Cup and deserves his call-up. &quot;There is big competition in some departments and not so much in others. There were one or two players who were unfortunate just to miss out.&quot; Back-row forwards David Wallace and Victor Costello are omitted, with O&#x27;Sullivan having Quinlan, Wilson, Simon Easterby, Anthony Foley, Denis Leamy and Johnny O&#x27;Connor vying for the three positions.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>With David Humphreys, Kevin Maggs, Simon Best and Tommy Bowe again included, it is Ulster&#x27;s biggest representation in a training panel for quite some time. Munster and Leinster have 12 and 11 players in the squad respectively while Jackman is the sole Connacht representative. Four British-based players are also included. Ulster forward Ronan McCormack said he was &quot;totally shocked&quot; to be included. &quot;I&#x27;m really looking forward to it,&quot; said McCormack. &quot;I played with guys like Brian O&#x27;Driscoll and Denis Hickie back in my school days in Leinster so I do know a few of them although not that well. &quot;It will be great to work with them.&quot;</p>
