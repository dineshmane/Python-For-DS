					<p>Khodorkovsky quits Yukos shares</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Jailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has transferred his controlling stake in oil giant Yukos to a business partner.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Mr Khodorkovsky handed over his entire 59.5% stake in holding company Group Menatep - which controls Yukos - to Leonid Nevzlin. A close ally of the ex-Yukos boss, Mr Nevzlin is currently based in Israel. Mr Khodorkovsky handed over his stake after the forced sale of Yukos&#x27; core oil production unit, Yuganskneftegaz to pay a giant tax bill.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Yuganskneftegaz was sold off at auction in December last year, eventually falling into the hands of state oil firm Rosneft in a deal worth $9.4bn (Â£5bn). &quot;Since the sale of Yuganskneftegaz, I have been delivered of (all) responsibility for the business that remains and the group&#x27;s money as a whole,&quot; Mr Khodorkovsky said. &quot;It is all over. As before, I see my future in public activity to build a civil society in Russia.&quot; Mr Nevzlin is Yukos&#x27; largest shareholder but is living in self-imposed exile in Israel. Yuganskneftegaz pumps around 1 million barrels of oil a day. It was sold by the Russian authorities to recover government tax claims against Yukos totalling over $27bn. Previously considered to be Russia&#x27;s richest man, with an estimated fortune of $15bn, Mr Khodorkovsky is currently on trial for fraud and tax evasion following his arrest in October 2003. However, the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country&#x27;s super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs. It is also believed that Mr Khodorkovsky was particularly targeted because he had started to bankroll political opponents of Mr Putin.</p>
