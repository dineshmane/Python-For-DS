					<p>Campbell to extend sprint career</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Darren Campbell has set his sights on running quicker than ever after deciding not to retire from sprinting.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Campbell, who won Olympic 4x100m relay gold, had been unsure about his future. But he told Five Live&#x27;s Sportsweek: &quot;I had to get back into training before I could decide because if I didn&#x27;t have the same hunger I&#x27;d have to walk away. &quot;I&#x27;ve started back and I&#x27;m thoroughly enjoying it. I&#x27;m looking forward to it. I&#x27;ve got to run under 10 seconds (for 100m) and under 20 seconds (for 200m).&quot; Campbell was part of the British quartet who shocked the Americans to win relay gold in Athens in August.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Newport-based athlete and team-mates Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis were rewarded with MBEs in the New Year Honours List. Campbell&#x27;s relay triumph made up for his disappointing displays in the individual 100m and 200m events in Athens, when he failed to reach the finals. The 31-year-old, who won Olympic 200m silver in Sydney in 2000, said during the Games that a hamstring injury had stopped him from running at his best.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>He was criticised at the time by former Olympic champion Michael Johnson, who cast doubt on Campbell&#x27;s injury claims. &quot;To go to Athens and finally get the gold I&#x27;ve been trying to get for 24 years was a big relief,&quot; said Campbell. &quot;It was a chance for me to prove that if I&#x27;d been fit I would have been challenging for the (individual) medals. &quot;Every season I go and challenge for the medals so why would last season have been any different? &quot;It&#x27;s just unfortunate that I picked up that injury just before the Olympics.&quot; Campbell set his 100m personal best of 10.04secs when he won the European title in Budapest in 1998. And he ran 20.13secs in the quarter-finals of the 200m in Sydney on the way to Olympic silver.</p>
