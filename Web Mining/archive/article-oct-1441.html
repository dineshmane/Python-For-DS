		<h2>French consumer spending rising</h2>
					<b>French consumer spending rising</b><br><br>
<font></font>			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>French consumers increased their spending by 1.5% in January, a figure which bodes well for the country&#x27;s economic growth, figures revealed.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The National Statistic Institute (INSEE) added that consumer spending in January rose 3.8% on a year-on-year basis. Rising sales of household equipment were behind the increase. The INSEE also said that French consumer prices fell 0.6% in January, but were up 1.6% on an annual basis.</p>

			<p>Despite the general increase in spending in January, French households bought fewer cars in January. According to the INSEE, car sales fell 2.8% in January, following a fall of 0.6% in December. But on a year-on-year basis, the sector still saw a sales increase of 6.5%. Consumer spending fuelled France&#x27;s economic growth in the last quarter of 2004 and analysts expect that it will continue to support the economy. &quot;It&#x27;s a growth that will remain fragile and vulnerable to risks like a strong rise in long-term interest rates, tension in the oil price,&quot; Emmanuel Ferry, from Exane BNP Paribas told Online News news agency.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Meanwhile in Italy, consumer confidence rose to its highest level since October 2004. Economic research group ISAE has said that Italian consumer confidence rose to 104.4 from 103.3, despite a slight deterioration in short-term sentiment.</p>
