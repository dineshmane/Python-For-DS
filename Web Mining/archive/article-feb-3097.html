					<p>Davenport hits out at Wimbledon</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>World number one Lindsay Davenport has criticised Wimbledon over the issue of equal prize money for women.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Reacting to a disputed comment by All England Club chairman Tim Phillips, the American said: &quot;I think it is highly insulting if prize money is taken away. &quot;Somebody, I think it was Mr Phillips, said they won&#x27;t have money for flowers at Wimbledon. That&#x27;s insulting.&quot; An All England club spokesperson denied Phillips made the remark, insisting: &quot;He definitely didn&#x27;t say it.&quot; The statement added: &quot;It was said by someone else and was a humorous aside at the end of a radio interview when the conversation had moved to talking about the Wimbledon grounds.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Davenport was speaking following the announcement that this week&#x27;s Dubai Duty Free event will join the US and Australian Opens in offering equal prize money for women. &quot;You hear about women playing only three sets while men play five,&quot; said Daveport. &quot;And the best women are never going to beat the best men. &quot;But it&#x27;s a different game you go to watch with the women - it doesn&#x27;t make it better or worse. &quot;Hopefully we will be able to change people&#x27;s minds.&quot; Serena Williams, who is also in Dubai, added: &quot;I&#x27;m obviously for equal prize money. &quot;Women&#x27;s tennis is exciting. Men&#x27;s tennis is exciting as well, but the women have it right now. &quot;If you are bringing in the spectators you should be able to reap what everyone else is able to reap.&quot;</p>
