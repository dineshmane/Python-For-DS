					<p>McClaren eyes Uefa Cup top spot</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Steve McClaren wants his Middlesbrough team to win their Uefa Cup group by beating Partizan Belgrade.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Boro have already qualified for the knockout stages alongside Partizan and Villareal, at the expense of Lazio. But boss McClaren is looking for a victory which would mean they avoid a team that has played in the Champions League in Friday&#x27;s third-round draw. &quot;To need a win to finish top is fantastic, but it is going to be a tough one,&quot; McClaren said. &quot;When the draw was made, I thought it was the toughest group of them all - and so it has proved. &quot;Lazio were favourites, Villarreal have been semi-finalists, and Partizan have fantastic experience in Europe. &quot;The pleasing thing is we did the business in the first two games. &quot;Winning those two has put us in a great position and it has been a fantastic experience playing these teams.&quot;</p>
