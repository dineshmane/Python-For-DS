					<p>Winter freeze keeps oil above $50</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Oil prices carried on rising on Wednesday after cold weather on both sides of the North Atlantic pushed US crude prices to four-month highs.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls took crude oil prices past $50 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since November. Declines in the dollar have also contributed to the rising oil price. US crude was trading at $51.39 at 0710 GMT in Asian electronic trade on Wednesday. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 at $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Opec members said on Tuesday that, given such high prices, the cartel saw no reason to cut its output.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Although below last year&#x27;s peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004&#x27;s average of $41.48. Brent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Much of western Europe and the north east of America has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. &quot;The primary factor is the weak dollar,&quot; said Victor Shum, a Singapore-based analyst with Purvin and Gertz. Expectations that a rebound in the dollar would halt the oil price rise were not immediately borne out on Wednesday morning, as oil prices carried on upwards as the dollar strengthened against the euro, the pound and the yen.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Several Opec members said on Tuesday that a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. &quot;I agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,&quot; Fathi Bin Shatwan, Libya&#x27;s oil minister, told Online News. &quot;I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,&quot; he added.</p>
