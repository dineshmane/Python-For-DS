		<h2>Soaring oil &#x27;hits world economy&#x27;</h2>
					<b>Soaring oil &#x27;hits world economy&#x27;</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>The soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world&#x27;s major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>In its latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut its growth predictions for the world&#x27;s main industrialised regions. US growth would reach 4.4% in 2004, but fall to 3.3% next year from a previous estimate of 3.7%, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Forecasts for Japanese growth were also scaled back to 4.0% from 4.4% this year and 2.1% from 2.8% in 2005. But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. &quot;There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future,&quot; said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD&#x27;s chief economist. The price of crude is about 50% higher than it was at the start of 2004, but down on the record high of $55.67 set in late October.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. &quot;The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters,&quot; Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the Online News&#x27;s World Business Report. &quot;The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005.&quot; China&#x27;s booming economy and a &quot;spectacular comeback&quot; in Japan - albeit one that has faltered in recent months - would help world economic recovery, the OECD said. &quot;Supported by strong balance sheets and high profits, the recovery of business investment should continue in North America and start in earnest in Europe,&quot; it added. However, the report warned: &quot;It remains to be seen whether continental Europe will play a strong supportive role through a marked upswing of final domestic demand.&quot; The OECD highlighted current depressed household expenditure in <i>Germany</i> and the eurozone&#x27;s over-reliance on export-led growth.</p>
