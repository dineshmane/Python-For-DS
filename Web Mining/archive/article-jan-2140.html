					<p>S Korean lender faces liquidation</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Creditors of South Korea&#x27;s top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>LG Card&#x27;s creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. The firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in January 2004, which gave control to the creditors. LG Group has said any package should reflect the firm&#x27;s new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden. At least seven million people in South Korea use LG Card&#x27;s plastic for purchases.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>LG Card&#x27;s creditors have threatened parent group LG Group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;Creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against LG Group if LG Card is liquidated,&quot; said Yoo Ji-chang, governor of Korean Development Bank (KDB) - one of the card firm&#x27;s major creditors. LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. It says it wants &quot;fair and reasonable guidelines&quot; on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of LG Card. The creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, KDB said. Analysts believe a compromise is likely. &quot;LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card,&quot; said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>LG Card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange. The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. LG card&#x27;s creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn. &quot;Eventually, LG Group will have to participate, but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions,&quot; said Mr Kim.</p>
