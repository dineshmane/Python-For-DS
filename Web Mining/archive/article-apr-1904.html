			<p>Electrolux saw its shares rise 14% on Tuesday after it said it would be shifting more of its manufacturing to low-cost countries.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The Swedish firm, the world&#x27;s largest maker of home appliances, said it is to relocate about 10 of its 27 plants in western Europe and North America. It did not say which facilities would be affected, but intends moving them to Asia, eastern Europe and Mexico. The company has two manufacturing sites in County Durham. It makes lawn and garden products in Newton Aycliffe, and cookers and ovens in Spennymoor. The Newton Aycliffe plant could also be affected by Electrolux&#x27;s separate announcement that it is to spin-off its outdoor products unit into a new separate company.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Electrolux&#x27;s subsidiary brands include AEG, Zanussi and Frigidaire. The company said it was speeding up its restructuring programme, which aims to save between £190m and £265m annually from 2009. &quot;We see that about half the plants in high-cost countries - that is around 10 - are at risk,&quot; said Electrolux chief executive Hans Straberg. &quot;It looks pretty grim,&quot; said Swedish trades union official Ulf Carlsson. &quot;What are we going to end up producing in Sweden?&quot;</p>
