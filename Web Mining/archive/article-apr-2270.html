					<p>Houllier praises Benitez regime</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier has praised the work of his Anfield successor Rafael Benitez.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Houllier was angry at reports that he has been critical of Benitez since the Spaniard took over at Liverpool. But Houllier told Online News Sport: &quot;In private and in public, I have stressed I believe Rafa is doing a good job. He is the right man at the right place. &quot;Rafa is a good coach and a good man. I&#x27;ve spoken to him since he has been at Liverpool and never criticised him.&quot; Houllier also revealed he is now ready to return to the game after leaving Liverpool in May following six years at Anfield.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The former France boss has been linked with a host of jobs and pulled out of the race to succeed Mark Hughes as <i>Wales</i> national coach. He has been working for Uefa, covering the Premiership for French television and also coaching in Brazil with national coach Carlos Alberto Perreira. Houllier said: &quot;If a good club comes up at the right time then yes, I am ready to come back. &quot;It has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and I have learned things. &quot;I have been involved in football since leaving Liverpool and my batteries are recharged.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Houllier has been impressed with the quality in the Premiership after watching as a pundit - particularly with Jose Mourinho&#x27;s work at leaders Chelsea. He said: &quot;Chelsea are doing very well. They have some very good creative players in Damien Duff and Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba showed he can change the face of a game when he came on against Newcastle. &quot;They have got a good team spirit and are strong mentally. They have shown they can cope with all the pressure put on them because of the expectations and cope well with Jose&#x27;s principles. &quot;Jose had results before he came to Chelsea and I think he will have an impact in the Premiership because he manages his team very cleverly.&quot; And Houllier, away from his brief at Liverpool, has been hugely impressed with the Premiership. He said: &quot;It is a very exciting league. It is entertaining, goals are scored and teams are always trying to win. &quot;It has been very interesting to watch the game from a different perspective. &quot;Games switch from end-to-end and there is more pace to the Premiership than other leagues. It is a very good product.&quot;</p>
