					<p>Sella wants Michalak recall</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Former France centre Philippe Sella believes coach Bernard Laporte must recall Frederic Michalak to give his side any chance of beating Ireland.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half Yann Delaigue in the RBS Six Nations to date. But he told Online News Sport: &quot;Michalak is the answer both now and for the future. Delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back Michalak. &quot;He does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset Ireland.&quot; The 22-year-old Michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after Delaigue impressed for Castres early in the season. With Michalak overlooked, the French stuttered to narrow wins over <i>Scotland</i> and then <i>England</i> before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to Wales. &quot;The <i>Wales</i> game was amazing to watch but never did I think the French could lose that game at half-time,&quot; said Sella.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Their only mistakes were that they didn&#x27;t score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second... but only a little bit.&quot; Sella, however, insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire Laporte, despite the defeat at the Stade de France. &quot;This season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 World Cup,&quot; said Sella, &quot;which Laporte is doing very well. The French get better every game. &quot;It&#x27;s difficult, though, when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel. &quot;But he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to World Cup victory. &quot;As a result, it is important that people give him time. It may not seem good now that we&#x27;re not winning the Grand Slam but no one will care in two years time if we&#x27;re world champions.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The majority of media criticism centred on the way in which France produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games. But while Sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against Wales, he said &quot;the win was most important&quot;. &quot;Winning is all that matters,&quot; he added. &quot;Ok, the flair may not have been so good, but the discipline, organisation and defence was there, which are all important ahead of 2007.&quot; France play what Sella believes is their hardest game of the Six Nations against <i>Ireland</i> in Dublin on Saturday 12 March. The French go into the game as clear underdogs. But Sella added: &quot;People forget that France can still win the Six Nations and they&#x27;ll be focused on that. &quot;But <i>Ireland</i> will be going for even more in front of their home crowd. It&#x27;s going to be tough.&quot;</p>
