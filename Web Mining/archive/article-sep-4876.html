					<p>ID theft surge hits US consumers</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Almost a quarter of a million US consumers complained of being targeted for identity theft in 2004, official figures suggest.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The Federal Trade Commission said two in five of the 635,173 reports it had from consumers concerned ID fraud. ID theft occurs when criminals use someone else&#x27;s personal information to steal credit or commit other crimes. Internet auctions were the second biggest source of fraud complaints, comprising 16% of the total. The total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546m (Â£290m).</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The report marks the fifth year in a row in which identity fraud has topped the table. The biggest slice of the 246,570 ID fraud cases reported - almost 30% - concerned abuses of people&#x27;s credit. Misusing someone&#x27;s identity to claim new credit cards or loans comprised 16.5% of the total, with almost 12% coming from false claims on existing credit. Another 18% came from attempts to rip off people&#x27;s bank accounts, while 13% of cases concerned attempts to defraud employers by abusing someone else&#x27;s identity. Outside the field of ID theft, 53% of the near-400,000 complaints were internet-related. Among the 100,000 internet auction complaints, the failure of sellers to deliver or the supply of sub-standard goods were the most common woes reported. Catalogue and home-shopping frauds were next in line, accounting for 8% of total complaints, while concerns about internet services and computers - including spyware found on people&#x27;s PCs and undisclosed charges for websites - amounted to 6% of complaints.</p>
