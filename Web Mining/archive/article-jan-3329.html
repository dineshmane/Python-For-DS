					<p>SFA awaits report over Mikoliunas</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Scottish Football Association is awaiting referee Hugh Dallas&#x27;s report before acting against Hearts winger Saulius Mikoliunas.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mikoliunas, 20, barged linesman Andy Davis, who had advised Dallas to award Rangers an injury-time penalty in Hearts&#x27;s 2-1 defeat at Tynecastle. &quot;He was sent off for violent conduct in the 90th minute but we don&#x27;t know if he did something else after the whistle. &quot;We don&#x27;t know how many red cards he was shown,&quot; said an SFA statement. Hearts could also face action after three fans were arrested for throwing coins on the pitch. Rangers&#x27; striker Dad Prso was also sent off during the same incident when he received a second yellow card for wrestling the ball away from Craig Gordon and leaving the Hearts keeper on the ground. The SFA said: &quot;Once the referee&#x27;s report comes in then we&#x27;ll immediately look at things.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;We don&#x27;t normally get the reports until a couple of days after the game but we&#x27;re well aware of what happened here. &quot;Prso was sent off for two cautions, and that will just be a one-match suspension.&quot; The SFA is certain to come down hard on Mikoliunas after Southampton&#x27;s David Prutton was banned for 10-games on Wednesday by the English FA for shoving referee Alan Wiley. Hearts&#x27; boss John Robertson said: &quot;Mikoliunas has thrown his chest against the assistant referee&#x27;s chest and got a red card for it. &quot;The officials have got to take into account the fact he&#x27;s a young lad. &quot;But people have got to take into account why he was incensed. Why were 10,000 Hearts fans incensed? &quot;Why did nobody from the Rangers&#x27; bench claim for a penalty kick?&quot; Rangers&#x27; boss Alex McLeish accepted referee Dallas had no option but to send Prso off. McLeish said: &quot;I&#x27;m glad to see the spirit of the players fighting to the very end - literally with Dado trying to get the ball back from Craig Gordon. &quot;But it was over-zealousness and I don&#x27;t think Hugh had any option.&quot;</p>
