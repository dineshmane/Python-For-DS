		<h2>Steel firm &#x27;to cut&#x27; 45,000 jobs</h2>
					<b>Steel firm &#x27;to cut&#x27; 45,000 jobs</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mittal Steel, one of the world&#x27;s largest steel producers, could cut up to 45,000 jobs over the next five years, its chief executive has said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Netherlands-based company is due to complete its $4.5bn acquisition of US firm ISG next month, making it one of the largest global firms of its kind. However, Lakshmi Mittal has told investors the combined company will have to shed thousands of jobs. The Indian-born magnate did not say where the job losses would fall.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mr Mittal told US investors that once the acquisition of International Steel Group was completed, the company would aim to reduce its workforce by between 7,000 and 8,000 annually. This could see its workforce trimmed from 155,000 to 110,000 staff by 2010. &quot;We are investing in modernisation so employees will go down,&quot; Mr Mittal told the conference in Chicago.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mittal Steel was formed last year when Mr Mittal&#x27;s LNM Holdings merged with Dutch firm Ispat. A combination of Mittal Steel and ISG would have annual sales of $32bn (Â£16.7bn; 24.1bn euros) and a production capacity of 70 million tonnes.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A Mittal Steel spokeman said that no decisions on job cuts have been made yet. &quot;We are trying to create a sustainable steel industry and if we want to do that, we have to invest in new technology,&quot; a spokesman said. Mittal Steel has operations in 14 countries. Many of its businesses - particularly those in eastern Europe - were previously state owned and have huge workforces. It employs 50,000 staff in Kazakhstan alone, and has large operations in Romania, the Czech Republic, South Africa and the United States.</p>
