		<h2>Taylor poised for Scotland return</h2>
					<p>Taylor poised for <i>Scotland</i> return</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Simon Taylor has been named in the <i>Scotland</i> squad for Saturday&#x27;s Six Nations clash with Italy.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The 25-year-old number eight made a scoring return for Edinburgh at the weekend - his first game in a year for the capital side. Taylor suffered knee ligament damage playing against <i>Ireland</i> in Dublin in the 2004 Six Nations championship. &quot;Simon is one of Scotland&#x27;s truly world class players so it is a huge bonus,&quot; said team-mate Chris Paterson. &quot;He brings a whole new dimension to us, especially in defence and his ability to slow the opposition ball down could be key against Italy if he is involved.&quot; Taylor has turned out for English side Saracens in recent weeks during a short-term loan to improve his fitness.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Edinburgh were not in action during the first two weeks of this season&#x27;s Six Nations. So Taylor played the last 20 minutes of Saracens&#x27; win over Northampton and then 40 minutes in a friendly against South African Super 12 side The Cats. <i>Scotland</i> coach Matt Williams is due to name his match-day 22 on Thursday. Both <i>Scotland</i> and Italy have lost their opening two Six Nations games and, just like last season&#x27;s encounter which Italy won, this weekend&#x27;s game could turn out to be a battle to avoid the wooden spoon.</p>
