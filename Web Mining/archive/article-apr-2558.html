					<p>McCall earns Tannadice reprieve</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Dundee United manager Ian McCall has won a reprieve from the sack, with chairman Eddie Thompson calling for an end to speculation over his future.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>It is understood that McCall would have been sacked if Sheffield Wednesday manager Paul Sturrock had been willing to return to Tannadice. But Sturrock has distanced himself from the position. &quot;We&#x27;re in a difficult situation. We must get out of it through the efforts of current personnel,&quot; said Thompson. &quot;Ian McCall and I have had a long and detailed talk about a number of areas including the current league position and the manner of the exit from the League Cup,&quot; he added. &quot;However, the continuing speculation is doing no one any good, especially as we have several crucial games coming up. &quot;The minds of the coaching staff and the players have to be on those games and those games only. &quot;Our season would of course improve considerably if in the next few weeks we achieved some improved league results and there is also the potential of another cup semi-final, subject to the draw.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;All that matters at the present time - is us all having a total focus on the games ahead and a positive series of results being achieved.&quot; Dundee United players had expressed their solidarity with McCall after their side&#x27;s 3-0 Scottish Cup win over Queen of the South. &quot;We want the boss to stay, we don&#x27;t want someone else coming in,&quot; said Jim McIntyre. &quot;Hopefully now he gets the chance to stay.&quot; Keeper Tony Bullock echoed McIntyre&#x27;s sentiments. &quot;I think all the boys are behind Ian McCall,&quot; he added. &quot;At the moment it is all speculation and we have got to rise above all that and do a job on the pitch.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>On Saturday, Sturrock insisted that he had unfinished business with Wednesday, who are fourth in League One. &quot;I&#x27;ve only been here five months and I don&#x27;t expect to be leaving very, very soon,&quot; he said. &quot;I can appreciate the rumours because I&#x27;ve emphasised my thoughts and ambitions to go back to Dundee United. &quot;I can assure you the timescale is not the right one. &quot;It (Dundee United) is my team. I had five years there as a coach, six as a player, two years as a manager - once you&#x27;ve done that kind of thing, it&#x27;s the result you look for. &quot;The important thing now is I&#x27;ve come here to do a job and I&#x27;m going to try to finish it.&quot;</p>
