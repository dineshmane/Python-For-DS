			<p></p>
			<p>Second seed Andre Agassi suffered a comprehensive defeat by Jurgen Melzer in the quarter-finals of the SAP Open.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Agassi was often bamboozled by the Austrian&#x27;s drop shots in San Jose, losing 6-3 6-1. Defending champion and top seed Andy Roddick rallied to beat Sweden&#x27;s Thomas Enqvist 3-6 7-6 (8-6) 7-5. But unseeded Cyril Saulnier beat the fourth seed Vincent Spadea 6-2 6-4 and Tommy Haas overcame eighth seed Max Mirnyi 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-3) 6-2. Melzer has now beaten Agassi in two of their three meetings.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I had a good game plan and I executed it perfectly,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s always tough to come out to play Andre. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want him to play his game. He makes you run like a dog all over the court.&quot; And Agassi, who was more than matched for power by his opponent&#x27;s two-handed backhand, said Melzer was an example of several players on the tour willing to take their chances against him. &quot;A lot more guys are capable of it now,&quot; said the American. &quot;He played much better than me. That&#x27;s what he did both times. &quot;I had opportunities to loosen myself up,&quot; Agassi added. &quot;But I didn&#x27;t convert on the big points.&quot;</p>
