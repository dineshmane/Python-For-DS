					<b>More movies head to Sony&#x27;s PSP</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Movies Open Water and Saw are among those to be made available for Sony&#x27;s PSP games console.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Film studio Lions Gate entertainment has announced an initial list of 12 movies that will be on the UMD format used by the handheld. &quot;The typical buyer of the machine [is] the core demographic to whom our films generally appeal,&quot; said Steve Beeks, president of Lions Gate. Already available in Japan, the PSP is released in the US on 24 March. Spider-Man 2 on UMD will be given to the first million customers in the US.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Punisher and House of the Dead along with older titles such as Total Recall and Rambo: First Blood, will be in the UMD format, with disks costing between $20 (£10.40) to $30 (£15.60) for new titles and $10 (£5.20) to $20 for older films.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;When we first saw the machine and started talking to Sony, we immediately decided it was going to be a winner, both from the gaming perspective and from the perspective of people watching movies on the go,&quot; Mr Beeks said. The disks, which are smaller than DVDs, only work in Sony&#x27;s PSP and can hold up to 1.8GB of data. &quot;We actually believe people who buy the UMD would not have bought it on DVD,&quot; he said. &quot;There are people who will want UMD because of the portability. Maybe they&#x27;re already taking the games with them out of the house, and they&#x27;re bigger gamers than they are movie watchers.&quot; Four movies have already been announced for PSP. They are: XXX, Hellboy, Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Once Upon a Time in Mexico.</p>
