					<p>O&#x27;Connor aims to grab opportunity</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Johnny O&#x27;Connor is determined to make a big impression when he makes his RBS Six Nations debut for <i>Ireland</i> against <i>Scotland</i> on Saturday.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The Wasps flanker replaces Denis Leamy but O&#x27;Connor knows that the Munster man will be pushing hard for a recall for the following game against England. &quot;It&#x27;s a &#x27;horses for courses&#x27; selection really,&quot; said O&#x27;Connor. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of competition here and I can&#x27;t just drag my heels around if I don&#x27;t get picked.&quot; It looks a definite head-to-head battle between himself and 23-year-old Leamy - three stone heavier than O&#x27;Connor - for the number seven role against the world champions. Nonetheless, all O&#x27;Connor is currently concerned about is making an impression while winning his third cap.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;Missing the Italian game was disappointing certainly, but you can&#x27;t dwell on these things - it&#x27;s part and parcel of rugby. &quot;Denis has been playing really well and deserved his opportunity. &quot;It&#x27;s a good situation to be in if there are good players around you, pushing for a place in the side.&quot; O&#x27;Connor, who celebrated his 25th birthday on Wednesday, was touted by Wasps director of rugby Warren Gatland as a possible 2005 Lions Test openside as far back as last September. And his reputation as a breakdown scavenger and heavy hitter has seen him come to the forefront of O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s mind for the Scottish tussle. O&#x27;Connor added: &quot;It will be interesting to see how situations on the deck is reffed, with the new laws having come in.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Obviously the breakdown a big part of what I do on the pitch so I&#x27;m hoping to hold some influence there against what is a very solid Scottish pack.&quot; O&#x27;Connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over South Africa last November.</p>
