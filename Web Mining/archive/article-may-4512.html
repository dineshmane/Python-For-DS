					<p>Beckham hints at Man Utd return</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>England captain David Beckham said he would return to Manchester United if he ever leaves Real Madrid.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Beckham left United in July 2003 after falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson and has been linked with a return to London if he decided to move back to England. &quot;If I ever leave I would go back to United and work with Sir Alex again, definitely,&quot; he told the Daily Mirror. &quot;Manchester United were the club that I grew up with and felt that I would always be there my whole career.&quot; However, Beckham insisted he was happy at Real, and said he still had plenty to prove in Spain.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I have been here for a year and a half and I have not played my best football in the past few months,&quot; he said. &quot;But I am happy. I am playing with some of the best players in the world and I want to win the top prizes like the Spanish league and the Champions League.&quot; Meanwhile, Beckham said he would fight for his international place amid pressure from Manchester City&#x27;s rising star Shaun Wright-Phillips. &quot;He deserves his chance because of the way he has been playing and I am genuinely pleased to see him doing so well,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>&quot;People ask me if I&#x27;m worried about him. I&#x27;m not worried because I am proud of the <i>England</i> team and I want the best for it. &quot;I&#x27;m the captain. It&#x27;s in my interests to have the best players in the team as well. &quot;I am not a jealous person and I am pleased for young kids coming through. We are talking about team-mates of mine. &quot;Shaun is a threat to me because he plays in the same position, but we can also play in other positions. &quot;I believe I will still be in the <i>England</i> team in 2006. I believe I will be <i>England</i> captain for that World Cup.&quot;</p>
