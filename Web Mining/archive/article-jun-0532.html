		<h2>Britannia members&#x27; £42m windfall</h2>
					<p>Britannia members&#x27; £42m windfall</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>More than 800,000 Britannia Building Society members are to receive a profit share worth on average £52 each.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Members of the UK&#x27;s second largest building society will share £42m, with 100,000 receiving a windfall of more than £100. Depending on how much they borrow or invest, members earn &quot;reward&quot; points which entitle them to a share of the society&#x27;s profits. The payouts are bigger than last year, because of stricter eligibility rules. Last year, Britannia members shared £42m, but the average payment was only £38.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>To qualify for this year&#x27;s payment, customers must have been members for at least two years on 31 December 2004. Britannia has also stopped making payments to members if they are worth less than £5.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>To qualify for the profit share, members must have either a mortgage, or an investment account other than a deposit account. Customers can also qualify if they have Permanent Interest Bearing Shares (PIBS). The profit share scheme was introduced in 1997 and has paid out more than £370m. Britannia will unveil its results on Wednesday.</p>
