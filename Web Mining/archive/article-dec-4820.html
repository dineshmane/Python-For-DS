					<b>Oil rebounds from weather effect</b><br><br>

			<span></span>
			<p>Oil prices recovered in Asian trade on Tuesday, after falling in New York on milder winter weather across the US.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>With winter temperatures staying relatively high in the northern US, a barrel of light crude ended Monday down $1.33 to $42.12. However crude prices have rebounded in Asia, rising to $42.30 a barrel for February delivery. In London, trading of Brent crude was suspended for a public holiday, but the price fell to $39.20 in the Far East.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>With milder temperatures expected to continue in the northern parts of the US over the next few days at least, analysts have said the price of oil may fall further - even if the decline was only temporary. &quot;Weather has been the Achilles&#x27; heel of this market,&quot; said ABN AMRO analyst John Brady. &quot;But it is winter in the northeast. Eventually we&#x27;ll get another cold blast.&quot; Despite a fall of more than $12 a barrel from the record highs reached in late October, the price of crude oil remains almost 30% higher than year-ago levels. Prices rose last week after militant attacks in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, briefly renewed fears that the supply chain might be broken in the world&#x27;s leading crude exporter. &quot;The market was panicked but fears essentially evaporated... since there was no follow-up,&quot; said Deborah White, senior economist for energy at SG Securities in Paris.</p>
