		<h2>Featured: &#x27;Golden economic period&#x27; to end</h2>
					<b>&#x27;Golden economic period&#x27; to end</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Ten years of &quot;golden&quot; economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly, City consultancy Deloitte has warned.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The UK economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market, triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment. Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown&#x27;s forecast of 3% to 3.5%. It also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>In its quarterly economic review, Deloitte said the UK economy had enjoyed a &quot;golden period&quot; during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>But it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major &quot;imbalances&quot; in the economy. Deloitte&#x27;s chief economic advisor Roger Bootle said: &quot;The biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown. &quot;Whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, Deloitte believes. Gordon Brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term, the firm claims. This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%. However, Deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the Bank of <i>England</i> to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. It expects a series of &quot;aggressive&quot; interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006. &quot;Although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong, it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the UK economy,&quot; Mr Bootle.</p>
