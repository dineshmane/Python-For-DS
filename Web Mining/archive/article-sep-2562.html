					<p>Ericsson sees earnings improve</p>

			<p>Telecoms equipment supplier Ericsson has posted a rise in fourth quarter profits thanks to clients like Deutsche Telekom upgrade their networks.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Operating profit in the three months to 31 December was 9.5bn kronor (Â£722m; $1.3bn) against 6.3bn kronor last year. Shares tumbled, however, as the company reported a profit margin of 45.6%, less than the 47.3% forecast by analysts and down from 47.1% in the third quarter. Ericsson shares dropped 5.9% to 20.7 kronor in early trading on Thursday. However, the company remained optimistic about its earnings outlook after sales in the fourth quarter rose 9% to 39.4bn kronor. &quot;Long-term growth drivers of the industry remain solid,&quot; Ericsson said in a statement.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Chief executive Carl-Henric Svanberg explained that about &quot;27% of the world&#x27;s population now has access to mobile communications&quot;. &quot;This is exciting for a company with a vision of an all-communicating world,&quot; he added. Mr Svanberg, however, warned that the extra demand that had driven 2004 sales had already dissipated and it was &quot;business as usual&quot;. He added that sales in the first three months of 2005 would be subject to &quot;normal seasonality&quot;. For the whole of 2004, Ericsson returned a net profit of 19bn kronor, compared with a loss of 10.8bn kronor in 2003. Sales climbed to 131.9 billion kronor from 117.7bn kronor in 2003.</p>
