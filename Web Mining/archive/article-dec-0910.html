			<p>Australian tennis&#x27; top official has defended the Australian Open courts at Melbourne Park after criticism of the playing surface by Lleyton Hewitt.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Hewitt said he had had a &quot;gutful&quot; of trying to persuade them to make the surface faster but Tennis Australia&#x27;s Geoff Pollard rejected his comments. &quot;We did ask for it to be made faster than last year and, to my knowledge, it is faster,&quot; he said. &quot;We spent a substantial amount of money on modifications to make it faster.&quot; Hewitt, who has not got past the fourth round at Melbourne in seven attempts, had earlier said the surface was not worthy of such a prestigious tournament. But he said he would play on whatever surface he had to in order to have a chance of winning. The tournament starts on 17 January, and Pollard said the surface had been speeded up since last year&#x27;s tournament following complaints by several Australian players. But he refused to accept that the Melbourne surface may have had a bearing on Hewitt&#x27;s performances over the years. &quot;Lleyton&#x27;s proving how versatile he is on all surfaces,&quot; he said. &quot;It is faster than last year and that&#x27;ll be faster than the one Lleyton beat Roger Federer on in the Davis Cup in 2003.&quot;</p>
