			<p>Serena Williams has angrily rejected claims that she and sister Venus are a declining force in tennis.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The sisters ended last year without a Grand Slam title for the first time since 1998. But Serena denied their challenge was fading, saying: &quot;That&#x27;s not fair - I&#x27;m tired of not saying anything. &quot;We&#x27;ve been practising hard. We&#x27;ve had serious injuries. I&#x27;ve had surgery and after, I got to the Wimbledon final. I don&#x27;t know many who have done that.&quot; While Serena is through to the Australian Open semi-finals, Venus went out in the fourth round, meaning she has not gone further than the last eight in her last five Grand Slam appearances. But Serena added: &quot;Venus had a severe strain in her stomach. I actually had the same injury, but I didn&#x27;t tear it the way she did.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;If I would have torn it, I wouldn&#x27;t have been here. &quot;She played a player (Alicia Molik) that just played out of her mind and Venus made some errors that she probably shouldn&#x27;t have made.&quot; Serena also said people tended to forget the impact the 2003 murder of sister Yetunde Price had had on the family. &quot;To top it off, we have a very, very, very, very, very close family&quot; Serena continued. &quot;To be in some situation that we&#x27;ve been placed in in the past little over a year, it&#x27;s not easy to come out and just perform at your best when you realize there are so many things that are so important. &quot;So, no, we&#x27;re not declining. We&#x27;re here. I don&#x27;t have to win this tournament to prove anything. I know that I&#x27;m out here and I know that I&#x27;m one of the best players out here.&quot;</p>
