		<h2>No seasonal lift for house market</h2>
					<b>No seasonal lift for house market</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>A swathe of figures have provided further evidence of a slowdown in the UK property market.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), British Bankers Association (BBA) and Building Societies Association (BSA) all said mortgage lending was slowing. CML figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in November as the number of people buying new homes fell. Elsewhere, the BBA added underlying mortgage lending rose by £4m in November, compared to October&#x27;s £4.29m. The CML said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85,000 - the lowest total seen since February 2003.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Data from the CML showed lending fell to just over £25bn in November, from £25.5bn a year earlier. Separate figures from the Building Societies Association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood 32% lower than at the same time last year, at a seasonally-adjusted £2.98bn. The figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website Rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a &quot;winter sale&quot; and slash prices by up to 8%. Miles Shipside, commercial director at Rightmove, said sellers would have to be &quot;more realistic with their asking prices&quot; to tempt buyers. The average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190,329 in November to £189,733 in December, while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Rightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago. &quot;Even once the quieter holiday period is over, sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market. In any business, excess supply and low demand means one thing - cut prices,&quot; Mr Shipside said.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;The proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling, even in the current market.&quot; Overall, asking prices have fallen 3.3% from their July peaks as the equivalent of £6,500 has been cut from an average property. A host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005. &quot;What is apparent is a picture of a slowing market, but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole,&quot; CML director general Michael Coogan said. &quot;It&#x27;s a fairly consistent picture, showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again, which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market,&quot; Investec economist Philip Shaw said. &quot;However, the figures do suggest only a modest weakening, and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time, though a collapse is still unlikely.&quot;</p>
