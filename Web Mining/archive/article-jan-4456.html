					<b>Mourinho sends out warning shot</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho believes his team&#x27;s Carling Cup win over Manchester United has shown they have the strength to win the Premiership.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;It was important for us, not because we got into a final, but also the way we played,&quot; he said. &quot;The mentality and the strength we showed here was a message we sent. &quot;It is still difficult, we still have to win 11 matches to be champions but we have left a message here that we are really strong.&quot; Chelsea gave their manager a win on his 42nd birthday but Mourinho was prepared for a possible loss at Old Trafford. But the Blues are still on course for a four-pronged trophy assault as they are leading the Premiership title race and are in the FA Cup and Champions League.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>&quot;We can win four, we can lose four, but it would be normal to win something. To win the four is very, very difficult but it is still possible. &quot;There is a long way to do it but if you could give me the Premiership I would be very happy. &quot;This is just the final though, we have not won the competition and we have to now face another great team in Liverpool.&quot; &quot;I was ready to lose the game and leave Old Trafford with a smile just to pass a message of confidence. &quot;But my team would never lose their confidence or mentality just because of a defeat here.&quot;</p>
