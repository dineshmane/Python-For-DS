					<p>Wenger rules out new keeper</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says he has no plans to sign a new goalkeeper during the January transfer window.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Wenger has brought in Manuel Almunia for the last three games for the out-of-form Jens Lehmann - but the Spaniard himself has been prone to mistakes. There have been suggestions that Wenger will swoop for a high-quality shot-stopper in the New Year. But he told the Evening Standard: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel it will be necessary to bring in a new goalkeeper in January.&quot; The Gunners manager refused to comment on the difficult start that 27-year-old Almunia has made to his career at Highbury. And he would not be drawn on whether Lehmann would return for the top-of-the table clash with Chelsea on Sunday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Almunia was at fault for Rosenborg&#x27;s goal in Arsenal&#x27;s 5-1 Champions League win on Tuesday and had some hairy moments in last week&#x27;s win over Birmingham. But Wenger said earlier this week that his indifferent form was down to pressure caused by being under scrutiny from the media. &quot;The debate has gone on too long. Everyone has an opinion and I do not have to add to it,&quot; Wenger added. Arsenal have been linked with Middlesbrough keeper Mark Schwarzer, Fulham&#x27;s Edwin van der Sar and Parma&#x27;s Sebastien Frey. And Wenger has no immediate plans to recall former <i>England</i> Under-21 international Stuart Taylor from his loan spell at Leicester.</p>
