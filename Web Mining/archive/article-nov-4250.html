					<p>Mexicans tracking unhappy Juninho</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz hope to sign Juninho if the Brazilian decides to leave Celtic frustrated at his lack of first-team action.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Their president, Gustavo Parente Sanchez, says Juninho &quot;does not wish to remain in Scottish football anymore&quot;. Agent Brian Hassell insists that the 31-year-old Brazilian midfielder is determined to win back his place. &quot;But, if the manager is not going to pick him, that&#x27;s a different ball game,&quot; he told The Sun. &quot;That&#x27;s something we&#x27;d have to look at. Juninho deserves respect. He is not a little kid.&quot; Hassell warns that Juninho could reconsider his future at Celtic unless he is given a run of games by the end of the January transfer window.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Juninho was signed from Middlesbrough during the summer, but he has failed to live up to high expectations and has lost his place to 18-year-old Aiden McGeady. &quot;He has 50 caps for Brazil and he&#x27;s the best signing Celtic ever made,&quot; insisted Hassell. &quot;He wants to play for Martin O&#x27;Neill, but does Martin O&#x27;Neill want to play him? &quot;Juninho is not someone who has come through the Celtic ranks. He deserves much more respect.&quot; Sanchez is bullish about his hopes of prising Juninho from the Scottish champions, although Hassell believes Mexico would not be his preferred destination. &quot;We have already spoken with Juninho and he said, if he has no firm offer from a club in Spain, Veracruz will be his destination,&quot; Sanchez told his club&#x27;s official website. Celtic manager O&#x27;Neill is no respecter of reputations. &quot;The onus is on Juninho to force his way into the team,&quot; he said. &quot;Players get a game on merit. That&#x27;s the way it has always been and that is certainly the case at Celtic Park.&quot;</p>
