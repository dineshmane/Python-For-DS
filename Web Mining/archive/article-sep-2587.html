		<h2>Ireland 21-19 Argentina</h2>
					<p>Ireland 21-19 Argentina</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>An injury-time dropped goal by Ronan O&#x27;Gara stole victory for <i>Ireland</i> from underneath the noses of Argentina at Lansdowne Road on Saturday.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>O&#x27;Gara kicked all of Ireland&#x27;s points, with two dropped goals and five penalties, to give the home side a 100% record in their autumn internationals. An impressive Argentina appeared in control until the dying seconds. The Pumas shocked the Irish early on with a try from Federico Aramburu, and Felipe Contepomi kicked 14 points. The well-drilled and sharper Pumas out-played and out-thought <i>Ireland</i> in the early stages. Indiscipline allowed Argentina&#x27;s Leinster fly-half Contepomi to open the scoring in the third minute with a straightforward penalty. He was on the mark again two minutes later when Argentina shocked a ragged <i>Ireland</i> with the first try of the game. <i>Ireland</i> turned the ball over and Manuel Contepomi broke through an unstructured defence before feeding his midfield partner Aramburu to sprint in under the posts. O&#x27;Gara finally got <i>Ireland</i> on the board with a dropped goal in the ninth minute only for Contepomi to rifle over his second penalty two minutes later. Playing into a strong wind and rain, <i>Ireland</i> continued to come second best in tight situations, and turnovers began to mount up against a rugged defence. O&#x27;Gara managed to land his second penalty in the 36th minute, but once again Contepomi replied in kind four minutes into first-half injury time. The second-half started as the first had ended. O&#x27;Gara rifled over another penalty in the 45th minute, but Contepomi matched it three minutes later. The upper-body strength of the Pumas never allowed <i>Ireland</i> to take control up front, while the three-quarters had no space to manoeuvre. <i>Ireland</i> had to rely on O&#x27;Gara&#x27;s boot to keep in touch rather than any contrived running plays. The Munsterman landed two more penalties - one of them from 48 metres - to bring his team to within four points with 13 minutes on the clock remaining. And Ireland&#x27;s chance came when Argentina&#x27;s number eight Gonzalo Longo was yellow carded with six minutes to go for an offence in the line-out. O&#x27;Gara made no mistake as he rifled over his fifth penalty to set up a tense final few minutes. But <i>Ireland</i> showed great composure to get themselves into a position to allow O&#x27;Gara to thump over a massive drop goal to complete a tremendous, if fortuitous, comeback.</p>
