					<p>Souness backs Smith for Scotland</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Graeme Souness believes Walter Smith would be the perfect choice to succeed Berti Vogts as <i>Scotland</i> manager.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Souness&#x27;s former assistant at Rangers is hot favourite to take over from Vogts, who resigned on Monday. &quot;Walter is most definitely the ideal candidate for that job. He&#x27;d be perfect for it,&quot; Souness told Online News Sport. The Scottish Football Association has appointed Tommy Burns as provisional caretaker-boss for the friendly against Sweden on 17 November. &quot;He fits the bill because of his knowledge and understanding of the <i>Scotland</i> team and football. He is experienced and has been successful.&quot; Souness added: &quot;Walter is a real football person, as I know from working with him at Ibrox. &quot;On top of all that he is a proper human being who would command the instant respect of the players and everyone involved in Scottish football.&quot; Souness joined Sir Alex Ferguson in backing Smith&#x27;s claims. The Scottish Football Association is about to embark on the search for Vogts successor after appointing Tommy Burns in a caretaker capacity. Ferguson said: &quot;He (Smith) would be the outstanding candidate as far as I&#x27;m concerned. &quot;You need somebody who knows what they&#x27;re doing and Walter would bring a wealth of experience to the job.&quot; The Man Utd boss continued: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what credentials are needed to do the job but it&#x27;s a job that needs a lot of experience. &quot;He was my assistant with <i>Scotland</i> and here at Manchester United and he has also managed Glasgow Rangers. &quot;He would need to change the whole shape of Scottish football and radical changes are needed.&quot; Smith was assistant to Ferguson at the World Cup in Mexico in 1986. The former Everton and Rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as Manchester United assistant last term. Online News Sport understands that Smith would be willing to discuss taking over if he was approached by the Scottish FA.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>If he is tempted to take over, it seems almost certain Smith&#x27;s long-time right-hand man Archie Knox would also play a part in the national team set-up. Smith already has the backing of many pundits and fans, including former <i>Scotland</i> manager Craig Brown. Brown said: &quot;Walter is an outstanding candidate without doubt. &quot;He would be admirable choice. I spoke to him on Sunday and I got the impression he would take it. He was asking me about it and I was positive.&quot; Other candidates for the job include former <i>Scotland</i> midfielders Gordon Strachan and Gary McAllister and Vogts&#x27; assistant Tommy Burns.</p>
