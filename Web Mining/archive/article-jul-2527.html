					<p>Man Utd urged to seal Giggs deal</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ryan Giggs&#x27; agent has told Manchester United to end the deadlock surrounding the Welsh winger&#x27;s contract.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Giggs is signed up until 2006 and the 31-year-old is looking for a new two-year deal as he bids to end his playing days at Old Trafford. However, United have only offered a one-year extension in line with their policy of contract negotiations with players over 30. &quot;I don&#x27;t think he is asking for the world,&quot; said agent Harry Swales. He added: &quot;We are not banging on desks and slamming doors. We are just waiting for the gentlemen in grey suits to get back in touch with us. &quot;Ryan isn&#x27;t asking for any more money and he certainly doesn&#x27;t want to leave Manchester United. &quot;If he had his way, he would stay with them for the rest of his career. &quot;We have got on well with the board at United and long may that continue. But just at the moment, the ball is in their court.&quot; Newcastle and Bolton are reportedly interested in signing the midfielder, who has been one of the main influences behind United&#x27;s success over the last decade. However, Giggs has always insisted that he is keen to end his career at Old Trafford.</p>
