					<b>Venus stunned by Farina Elia</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Venus Williams suffered a first-round defeat for the first time in four years at the Dubai Championships.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Sylvia Farina Elia, who had lost all nine of her previous meetings with the American fifth seed, won 7-5 7-6 (8-6). Former Wimbledon champion Conchita Martinez and India&#x27;s Sania Mirza, the oldest and youngest players in the draw, also reached the second round. Martinez, 32, beat Shinobu Asagoe 6-4 6-4 and 18-year-old Mirza beat Jelena Kostanic 6-7 (7-2) 6-4 6-1. Mirza, the first Indian woman to win a WTA Tour title this month on home ground at Hyderabad, will now face US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But she is remaining confident. &quot;She (Kuznetsova) is a great player,&quot; she said. &quot;But everyone is beatable and I am looking forward to a great match.&quot; Williams though blamed her defeat by Farina Elia on injuries. &quot;Blisters were a factor, but mostly my stomach wasn&#x27;t that great,&quot; she said. &quot;I did it in the last tournament in the semi-finals, and I was serving at 40% in the final. &quot;The first time I served again was Sunday and there wasn&#x27;t a lot I could do out there. When your serve isn&#x27;t good it throws the rest of your game off too.&quot; She will wait to see how she recovers before deciding whether to take part in the Nasdaq-100 Open in Miami, starting on 21 March.</p>
