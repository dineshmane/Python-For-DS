		<h2>Euronext joins bid battle for LSE</h2>
					<b>Euronext joins bid battle for LSE</b><br><br>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Pan-European stock market Euronext has approached the London Stock Exchange (LSE) about a possible takeover bid.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The approach is at an early stage and therefore does not require a response at this point,&quot; LSE said. Talks with the European stock market and with rival bidder Deutsche Boerse will continue, the LSE said. Last week, the group rejected a £1.3bn ($2.5bn) takeover offer from Deutsche Boerse, claiming that it undervalued the business. LSE saw its shares surge 4.9% to a new high of 583p in early trade, following the announcement on Monday.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The offer follows widespread media speculation that Euronext would make an offer for LSE. Experts now widely expect a bidding war for Europe&#x27;s biggest stock market, which lists stocks with a total capitalisation of £1.4 trillion, to break out. Commentators say that a deal with Euronext, which owns the Liffe derivatives exchange in London and combines the Paris, Amsterdam and Lisbon stock exchanges, could potentially offer the LSE more cost savings than a deal with Deutsche Boerse.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A weekend report in the Telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at Euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump Deutsche Boerse&#x27;s offer. &quot;Because we already own Liffe in London, the cost savings available to us from a merger are far greater than for Deutsche Boerse,&quot; the newspaper quoted the executive as saying. Euronext chief executive Jean-Francois Theodore is reported to have already held private talks with LSE&#x27;s chief executive Clara Furse. Further reports had suggested that Euronext could make an offer in excess of the LSE&#x27;s 533p a share closing price on Friday. However, Euronext said it could not guarantee &quot;at this stage&quot; that a firm offer would be made for LSE. There has been extensive speculation about a possible takeover of the company since an attempted merger with Deutsche Boerse failed in 2000.</p>
