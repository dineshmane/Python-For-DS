		<h2>BT offers free net phone calls</h2>
					<b>BT offers free net phone calls</b><br><br>

			<p>BT is offering customers free internet telephone calls if they sign up to broadband in December.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Christmas give-away entitles customers to free telephone calls anywhere in the UK via the internet. Users will need to use BT&#x27;s internet telephony software, known as BT Communicator, and have a microphone and speakers or headset on their PC. BT has launched the promotion to show off the potential of a broadband connection to customers.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>People wanting to take advantage of the offer will need to be a BT Together fixed-line customer and will have to sign up to broadband online. The offer will be limited to the first 50,000 people who sign up and there are limitations - the free calls do not include calls to mobiles, non-geographical numbers such as 0870, premium numbers or international numbers. BT is keen to provide extra services to its broadband customers. &quot;People already using BT Communicator have found it by far the most convenient way of making a call if they are at their PC,&quot; said Andrew Burke, director of value-added services at BT Retail. As more homes get high-speed access, providers are increasingly offering add-ons such as cheap net calls. &quot;Broadband and telephony are attractive to customers and BT wants to make sure it is in the first wave of services,&quot; said Ian Fogg, an analyst with Jupiter Research. &quot;BT Communicator had a quiet launch in the summer and now BT is waving the flag a bit more for it,&quot; he added.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>BT has struggled to maintain its market share of broadband subscribers as more competitors enter the market. Reports say that BT has lost around 10% of market share over the last year, down from half of broadband users to less than 40%. BT is hoping its latest offer can persuade more people to jump on the broadband bandwagon. It currently has 1.3 million broadband subscribers.</p>
