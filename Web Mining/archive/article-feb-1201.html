					<p>Mido makes third apology</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ahmed &#x27;Mido&#x27; Hossam has made another apology to the Egyptian people in an attempt to rejoin the national team.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 21-year-old told a news conference in Cairo on Sunday that he is sorry for the problems that have led to his exclusion from the Pharaohs since July last year. Mido said: &quot;There isn&#x27;t much I have to say today, all there is to say is that I came specially from England to Egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all my mistakes.&quot; Mido was axed by former coach Marco Tardelli after failing to answer a national call-up, claiming he had a groin injury. But he then played in a friendly for his club AS Roma within 24 hours of a World Cup qualifying match at home to Cameroon last September. Mido added: &quot;It&#x27;s not my right to give orders and say when I want to play ... at the same time I will always make sure that I put the national&#x27;s team&#x27;s matches as my top priority. &quot;I feel that the national players are playing with a new spirit as I saw them play against Belgium (Egypt won 4-0 on Wednesday) and I simply want to add to their success. &quot;I do confess that I was rude to the Egyptian press at times but now I have gained more experience and know that I will never go anywhere without the press&#x27;s support. &quot;Many of the international stars like David Beckham and (Zinedine) Zidane had the press opposing them. &quot;So I&#x27;m now used to the fact that the press can be against me at times and I don&#x27;t have to overreact when this happens. Meanwhile, Egypt FA spokesman Methat Shalaby welcomed the apology and said no one had exerted pressure on Mido to apologise. &quot;Mido&#x27;s apology today does not negatively affect Mido in anyway, on the contrary it makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players,&quot; Shalaby said. Shalaby earlier said that after an apology Mido would be available for the national side if coach Hassan Shehata chose him. Mido joined Tottenham in an 18-month loan deal near the end of the January transfer window, scoring twice on his debut against Portsmouth.</p>
