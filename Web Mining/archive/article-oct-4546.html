					<b>Khodorkovsky ally denies charges</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>A close associate of former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky has told a court that fraud charges levelled against him are &quot;false&quot;.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Platon Lebedev has been on trial alongside Mr Khodorkovsky since June in a case centring around the privatisation of a fertiliser firm. The pair claim they are being punished by the authorities for the political ambitions of Mr Khodorkovsky. Mr Lebedev said there were &quot;absurd contradictions&quot; in the case. Opening his defence, he said he could not see the legal basis of the charges he faced, which also include allegations of tax evasion. &quot;To my embarrassment, I could not understand the file of complaints against me,&quot; he told a Moscow court. Mr Lebedev headed the Menatep group, the parent company of Yukos.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Mr Lebedev and Mr Khodorkovsky, who each face a possible 10 year jail sentence if convicted, will be questioned by a judge over the next few days. Mr Khodorkovsky began his testimony last week, telling the court that he objected to the way that the &quot;running of a normal business has been presented as a work of criminal fiction&quot;. The charges are seen by supporters as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country&#x27;s super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs. Yukos has been presented with a $27.5bn (Â£13bn) tax demand by the Russian authorities and its key Yugansk division was auctioned off to part settle the bill. The company&#x27;s effort to gain bankruptcy protection in the US - in a bid to win damages for the sale - were dismissed by a court in Texas.</p>
