		<h2>Pension hitch for long-living men</h2>
					<b>Pension hitch for long-living men</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Male life expectancy is much higher than originally estimated, leading pension researchers have said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated. Life expectancy at birth is 71 years for a manual worker and 79 years for a professional - a gap of eight years. But if measured at age 65 instead, the PPI said, a manual worker will live to 81 years and a professional worker to 86 years - a gap of just five years. The PPI&#x27;s estimate is higher because it excludes people who have died before they reach 65 years of age and also takes into account ongoing improvements in life expectancy.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The government has ruled out raising the state pension age, because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies. Chris Curry, PPI research director, said its calculations suggested there could be more pressure on state pension spending than originally envisaged. &quot;Even people in social class V [unskilled manual workers] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age,&quot; he said. Researchers have not updated life expectancy projections for women, who on average live longer than men.</p>
