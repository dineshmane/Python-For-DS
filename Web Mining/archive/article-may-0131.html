					<b>Benitez joy as Reds take control</b><br><br>

			<p>Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez was satisfied after his team&#x27;s 3-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen despite conceding a goal in the last minute.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Before the game if you had said the score will be 3-1 I would have happily accepted that,&quot; said Benitez. &quot;But you must realise that you have to concentrate right to the very last seconds of a game at this level. &quot;I have confidence that we can complete the task in Germany. I am always confident and we must be positive.&quot;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>

			<p>Benitez defended goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek, whose failure to hold on to Dimitar Berbatov&#x27;s weak drive allowed Franca to score with the last kick of the game - and give the German team a lifeline for the second leg. &quot;For me it was not Jerzy Dudek&#x27;s fault,&quot; added Benitez. &quot;He had played a very good game - and had we scored our other chances, nobody would be talking about about their goal. It would not have mattered. &quot;If we had scored our other chances it would not have been worth remembering that last goal. &quot;In my opinion Jerzy played well, made two very fine saves - and I am happy with him. &quot;If we lose 2-0 we are out but I think we can score in <i>Germany</i> - certainly one, and that will make all the difference.&quot; And the Liverpool boss is looking forward to having skipper Steven Gerrard, who was suspended for the Anfield leg, back for the return in Germany.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>&quot;Steven Gerrard is a key player for us,&quot; said Benitez. &quot;When he is on the pitch he makes everyone else play better - and the opposition pay special attention to him - which gives space for others. &quot;Steven is one of the best players in the world, but I need a team that is not about just one player. There must be 11 players on the pitch all doing well.&quot;</p>
