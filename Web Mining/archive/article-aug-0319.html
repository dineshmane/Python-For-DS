		<h2>Injury doubts beset Wales squad</h2>
					<b>Injury doubts beset <i>Wales</i> squad</b><br><br>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Wales have a clutch of injury worries before Wednesday&#x27;s international friendly against Hungary in Cardiff.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>West Ham&#x27;s Gavin Williams (ankle) looks certain to be out, so uncapped Wrexham defender Stephen Roberts is drafted in. Defenders Danny Gabbidon and Gareth Roberts, plus Ryan Giggs have hamstring concerns, while there are also doubts over Robbie Savage (groin). However, Manchester United winger Giggs is expected to recover in time to earn his 50th cap at the Millennium Stadium. There were also doubts over Gabbidon&#x27;s fellow Cardiff defender Rhys Weston, but the full-back appears to have shrugged off the knock he picked up in the Bluebirds&#x27; 1-0 loss to West Ham on Sunday. The news leaves <i>Wales</i> boss John Toshack short in defence for his first game in charge, with Aston Villa&#x27;s Mark Delaney injured and James Collins with the Under-21s. That could clear the way for new faces Danny Collins and Dave Partridge to make their <i>Wales</i> debuts.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Coyne (Burnley), Jones (Wolves), Roberts (Wrexham), Collins (Sunderland), Edwards (Wolves), Gabbidon (Cardiff), Page (Cardiff), Partridge (Motherwell), Ricketts (Swansea), Roberts (Tranmere), Weston (Cardiff), Davies (Tottenham), Fletcher (West Ham), Giggs (Man Utd), Koumas (West Brom), Robinson (Sunderland), Savage (Blackburn), Williams (West Ham), Bellamy (Newcastle), Earnshaw (West Brom), Hartson (Celtic).</p>
