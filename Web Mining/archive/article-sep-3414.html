		<h2>Wembley firm won&#x27;t make a profit</h2>
					<p>Wembley firm won&#x27;t make a profit</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Shares in Multiplex Group, which is building the new Wembley stadium, fell as much as 19% after it said it would not make any money on the project.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Australian firm said it would only break even on the 1.2bn Australian dollars (Â£458m; $874m) rebuild, after a rise in costs on the work. Any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor, it added. It cut A$68m from profit targets for Wembley and another UK project.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Investors were shaken by the news and the firm&#x27;s shares fell to a four month low of A$4.50, before recovering to close 16% down at A$4.67. The decline came despite Multiplex reporting an 11% rise in pre-tax profits to A$67.7m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts. Increased costs at Wembley and a separate development in London&#x27;s Docklands saw Multiplex&#x27;s construction division report profits of A$35.1m.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The firm said the result was below expectations but stressed that the majority of its UK projects - which also include the White City redevelopment scheme in west London - were performing strongly.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>To recoup any profit from Wembley, where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute, Multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors. These claims could take up to two years to resolve. &quot;Multiplex believes its claim are sound and ultimately will exceed the level needed to support the break even position,&quot; it said. &quot;It is expected that profits will be possible in future periods as the claims are finalised.&quot; Wembley Stadium is to due to be completed in January and will officially open for the 2006 FA Cup Final. Analysts expressed concern at the unexpected paring back in profit. &quot;Such a big writeback on the Wembley project in such a short period has impacted on management credibility,&quot; Simon Wheatley, from Goldman Sachs, told Online News.</p>
