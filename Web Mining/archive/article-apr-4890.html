					<p>Connors boost for British tennis</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Former world number one Jimmy Connors is planning a long-term relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association to help unearth the next Tim Henman.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The American spent three days at the LTA&#x27;s annual Elite Performance winter camp in La Manga earlier this week. &quot;Britain has the right attitude,&quot; said Connors. &quot;The more involved I can be with the LTA, the better. &quot;A short-term arrangement is just confusing. The kids will ask: &#x27;What am I doing there?&#x27;&quot; LTA chief executive, John Crowther, added: &quot;The relationship that Jimmy&#x27;s already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we&#x27;d like some more of it. &quot;We want to use Jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The camp played host to more than 30 leading senior and junior players, including Greg Rusedski, Arvind Parmar and Anne Keothavong. &quot;La Manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best,&quot; said Connors, speaking at Queen&#x27;s Club in London. &quot;What impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had. &quot;It was interesting to me to see kids of 15, 16, 17, with that desire and passion, and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them. &quot;Instilling the importance of work and practice is something you can&#x27;t buy. &quot;They know what&#x27;s been given to them and all they have to do is give back the effort, and every minute of practice they were doing that.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Speaking from La Manga, LTA performance director David Felgate told Online News Sport: &quot;Jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches, and very humble considering what he&#x27;s achieved. &quot;He worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and he&#x27;ll get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them. &quot;He made it clear from the word go he didn&#x27;t want it to be short-term. This is a 52-week-a-year job for me, it&#x27;s my life and my passion and it&#x27;s the same with the coaches. &quot;He respects that but he wants to be involved and have real input. And why would he stake his reputation on something that&#x27;s not going to be successful?&quot; Connors has also agreed to commentate for the Online News at next year&#x27;s Wimbledon Championships. He will work during the second week of the tournament.</p>
