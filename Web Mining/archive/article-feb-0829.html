					<p>Ferguson fears Milan cutting edge</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said his side&#x27;s task against AC Milan would not be made any easier by the absence of Andriy Shevchenko.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Milan&#x27;s talismanic European footballer of the year misses Wednesday&#x27;s Champions League first-leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone. &quot;It&#x27;s a loss (to Milan), but it could be worse if they didn&#x27;t have such quality to bring in,&quot; Ferguson said. &quot;How much they miss him I think they&#x27;ll know tomorrow night.&quot; Ferguson said Milan&#x27;s front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders. &quot;They can play Rui Costa and play Kaka forward. They can bring Serginho in and they can play (Jon Dahl) Tomasson,&quot; he said. Ferguson&#x27;s own goalscoring talisman Ruud van Nistelrooy is fit again, but the Scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the Dutchman, who has not played for three months.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;Ruud is the best striker in Europe. What I have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long,&quot; he said. &quot;His ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision.&quot; Ferguson, though, is confident his young players, particularly Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, are up to the task. &quot;We have an opportunity to win this cup this year, no question about that,&quot; he declared. &quot;With the maturity we see every week in Ronaldo and Rooney, the return of Van Nistelrooy and the form of Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, we must have a fantastic chance.&quot; It is a view shared by Rooney, who believes &quot;if we can get past Milan, we have a great chance&quot;. &quot;As soon as I knew we were playing Milan, I got excited. Looking at the draw, it is anyone&#x27;s trophy but we have every chance. &quot;Hopefully, we can get to that final in Turkey and bring the cup back to Manchester.&quot; Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted Europe&#x27;s most prestigious club title two seasons ago. Milan beat Juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at Old Trafford and Ancelotti said: &quot;We are all very happy to return (to Old Trafford) to play in the Champions League and this will give us great motivation.&quot; Ancelotti said he was aware of the threat United posed to his hopes of Champions League glory. &quot;It&#x27;s fundamental that we don&#x27;t allow them to take control of the game. Our intention is not to adapt to their play but to play our game,&quot; he said. &quot;They have great quality in attack, they use the wings a lot and we will have to make sure we stop them.&quot;</p>
