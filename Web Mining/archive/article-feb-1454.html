					<p>Davies favours Gloucester future</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Wales hooker Mefin Davies is likely to stay with English side Gloucester despite reported interest from the Neath-Swansea Ospreys.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Online News <i>Wales</i> understands the Ospreys are interested in the 32-year-old, but that he would prefer to stay where he is. Davies, one of the stars of Saturday&#x27;s RBS Six Nations win over England, is only on a year contract at Kingsholm. But the hooker has proved his worth to the Zurich Premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season. The summer demise of the Celtic Warriors region left Davies in the cold and forced him to take a semi-professional contract with Neath RFC. Although he got match time with the Ospreys at the request of the <i>Wales</i> management, he admitted before his move to Gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated. &quot;The WRU didn&#x27;t give me any help off the field, it was very disappointing,&quot; Davies said at the time. &quot;It was a hard time throughout the summer, then deciding whether to accept an offer from Stade Francais which would have ended my <i>Wales</i> career.&quot;</p>
