		<h2>Turkey knocks six zeros off lira</h2>
					<b>Turkey knocks six zeros off lira</b><br><br>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Turkey is to relaunch its currency on Saturday, knocking six zeros off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering its growing economy.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The change will see the end of such dizzyingly-high denominations as five million lira - enough for a short taxi ride - and the 20m note, worth $15. These valuations were the product of decades of inflation which, as recently as 2001, was as high as 70%. Inflation has since been tamed and economic prospects are improving.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The currency - officially to be known as the new lira - will be launched at midnight on 1 January. From that point, the one-million lira note will become the new one-lira coin. The government hopes the change will be seen as a promise of growing economic stability as Turkey embarks on the long process of trying to join the European Union.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>On an everyday level, it is hoped the change will stimulate more international trade and end confusion among foreign investors and Turks alike. &quot;The transition to the new Turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years,&quot; said Sureyya Serdengecti, head of the Turkish Central Bank. &quot;The new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years.&quot;</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>The Turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Turkey had to turn to the International Monetary Fund for financial assistance, accepting a $18bn loan in return for pushing through a wide-ranging austerity programme. These tough measures have borne fruit. Inflation fell below 10% earlier this year for the first time in decades while exports are up 30% this year. Meanwhile, the economy is expanding at a healthy rate, with 7.9% growth expected in 2004. The government hopes that the new currency will cement the country&#x27;s economic progress, two weeks after EU leaders set a date for the start of Turkey&#x27;s accession talks.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The slimmed-down lira is likely to be widely welcomed by the business community.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The Turkish lira has been like funny money,&quot; Tevfik Aksoy, chief Turkish economist for Deutsche Bank, told Associated Press. &quot;Now at least in cosmetic terms it will look like real currency.&quot; However, some do not feel quite so happy about seeing the nominal value of their investments reduced. &quot;If a person has 10 billion lira in investments this will suddenly decrease,&quot; shop owner Hayriye Evren, told Associated Press. &quot;This will definitely affect people psychologically.&quot;</p>
