			<span></span>
			<p>Lleyton Hewitt suffered a shock defeat to Taylor Dent in the quarter-finals of the Australian Hardcourt Championships in Adelaide on Friday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The top seed was a strong favourite for the title but went down 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 to the American. Dent will face Juan Ignacio Chela next after the fourth seed was too strong for Jurgen Melzer. Olivier Rochus beat third seed Nicolas Kiefer 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (8-6) 7-5 and will take on second seed Joachim Johansson. The Swede reached the last four by beating compatriot Thomas Enqvist 6-3 4-6 6-1. &quot;I felt like I was striking the ball much better,&quot; said Johansson.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I felt like I had a lot of break chances, I didn&#x27;t take care of them all, but I broke him four times and he only broke me once. &quot;I felt that was the key to get up in the set early.&quot; Hewitt played down his defeat and insisted he is focused solely on the Australian Open, which starts on 17 January. &quot;When you&#x27;ve been number one in the world for a couple of years and won a couple of slams, you look at the big picture and what motivates you,&quot; said Hewitt. &quot;That&#x27;s the Grand Slams and Melbourne&#x27;s as big for me as any of the four. Even if I don&#x27;t win Sydney next week it&#x27;s no big deal.&quot;</p>
