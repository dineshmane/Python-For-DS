					<p>Robinson answers critics</p>

			<span></span>
			<p>England captain Jason Robinson has rubbished suggestions that the world champions are a team in decline.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>England were beaten 11-9 by Wales in their Six Nations opener in Cardiff last week and face current champions France at Twickenham on Sunday. Robinson said: &quot;We are certainly not on the decline. You lose one game and it doesn&#x27;t make you a bad team. &quot;I have no doubt in the players we&#x27;ve got. We have still got the team to go out and beat anyone on our day.&quot; England find themselves striving to avoid a third successive championship defeat for the first time since 1987. But full-back Robinson believes the new-look England team can stop the rot against France.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Last weekend we should have won the game,&quot; he said. &quot;But if we can under-perform and lose by only two points then I am sure if we play well this week we will get the win we need. &quot;We proved that in the autumn - when we put in some excellent performances - and we just need to build on that.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;It was a disappointing start against Wales and we might be down on that. &quot;But we are certainly not out. We will come out fighting this week.&quot; Robinson also had words of comfort for 18-year-old Newcastle centre Mathew Tait, who made his international debut against Wales but has been demoted from the squad to face France.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I have had a word with Mathew,&quot; said Robinson. &quot;I still believe in him. He is an outstanding player but we have gone for Olly (Barkley) because of the kicking. &quot;Mathew has just got to take it on the chin, keep working hard like he is doing and I&#x27;m sure he will feature in some of the games.&quot;</p>
