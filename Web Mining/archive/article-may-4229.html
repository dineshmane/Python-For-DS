		<h2>O&#x27;Sullivan keeps his powder dry</h2>
					<p>O&#x27;Sullivan keeps his powder dry</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>When you are gunning for glory and ultimate success keeping the gunpowder dry is essential.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Ireland coach Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan appears to have done that quite successfully in the run-up to this season&#x27;s Six Nations Championship. He decreed after the 2003 World Cup that players should have a decent conditioning period during the year. That became a reality at the end of last summer with a 10-week period at the start of the this season. It may have annoyed his Scottish, and in particularly Welsh, cousins who huffed and puffed at the disrespect apparently shown to the Celtic League. We will say nothing of Mike Ruddock &#x27;&#x27;poaching&#x27;&#x27; eight of the Dragons side that faced Leinster on Sunday. But, like O&#x27;Sullivan, he was well within his rights, particularly when you are talking about the national side and pride that goes along with it. The IRFU has thrown their weight behind O&#x27;Sullivan, who must be glad that in the main, there is centrally-controlled contracts. Bar Keith Gleeson who is just returning from a broken leg, everyone of O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s squad is fit, fresh and standing at the oche ready to launch this season&#x27;s campaign.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But I doubt whether O&#x27;Sullivan is going to gloat about the handling of his players. He is not that sort of person. However, he may look at the overworked and injury-hit England, Wales and France squads whose players have been overworked, and then pat himself on the back for his foresight. But there is still the question of turning up and transferring that freshness into positive results when the referee signals the start of the game. Already <i>Ireland</i> are being earmarked as hot favourites in many quarters to go the whole hog this season. A first Grand Slam since Karl Mullen&#x27;s led the team to a clean sweep in 1948. With <i>England</i> and France visiting Lansdowne Road for the last time before the old darling is pulled down, everything looks perfectly placed. But in the days of yore that frightened the life out of any Irishman.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Under the burden of great expectations, <i>Ireland</i> have crumpled. Take the Triple Crown-winning side of 1985 under Mick Doyle. They were expected to up the ante further for a Grand Slam, only the second in Ireland&#x27;s history. What happened in 1986? Whitewashed. You see, Ireland, in any sport, love to be downsized. Then they can go out and prove a point to the contrary. It is the nature of the beast. But O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s side are very capable of proving a salient point this season. After their first Triple Crown for 19 years, they can live up to their success and take a further step up the ladder. O&#x27;Sullivan has kept faith and displayed loyalty to his players, and they have repaid him in spades ... and there is more to come. He has some old dogs in his squad, but he will come to this season&#x27;s championship with a different box of tricks, and a new verve to succeed. <i>Ireland</i> can indeed succeed, but just whisper it.</p>
