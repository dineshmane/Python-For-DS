		<h2>French boss to leave EADS</h2>
					<b>French boss to leave EADS</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>The French co-head of European defence and aerospace group EADS Philippe Camus is to leave his post.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mr Camus said in a statement that he has accepted the invitation to return full-time to the Lagardere group, which owns 30% of EADS. &quot;I will give up my role as soon as the board of directors asks me to do so,&quot; he said. Airbus head Noel Forgeard is now set to replace Mr Camus, bringing the company&#x27;s power struggle to an end. Fighting between Mr Camus and Mr Forgeard has hit the headlines in France and analysts feared that this fighting could destabilise the defence and aerospace group. French finance minister Herve Gaymard is on record as saying that he &quot;deplored&quot; the infighting at the company. The company should now be able put this dispute behind it, with the departure of Mr Camus and with the clear support given to Mr Forgeard by the Lagardere group, the main French shareholder of EADS. The other main shareholders of EADS are the French government (15%) , who also support Mr Forgeard, and Germany&#x27;s DaimlerChrysler (30%). Rainer Hertrich, the German co-head of EADS will also step down when his contract expires next year.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Mr Camus recently came under pressure as it became clear that the A380 superjumbo was running over budget. EADS - Airbus&#x27; majority owner - admitted earlier this week that the project was running 1.45bn euros (£1bn; $1.9bn) over budget. But Mr Forgeard has denied this, telling French media that there is no current overrun in the budget. &quot;But for the sake of transparency, we told our shareholders last week that if we look at the forecast for total costs of the project up to 2010, there is a risk that we will go over by around 10%, which is about 1bn euros (£686m; $1.32bn),&quot; he told France&#x27;s LCI Television. Due to enter service in 2006, the A380 will replace the Boeing 747 jumbo as the world&#x27;s biggest passenger aircraft.</p>
