					<b>Building giant in asbestos payout</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Australian building products group James Hardie has agreed to pay $1.1bn (Â£568m) to victims of asbestos-related diseases.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The landmark deal could see thousands of people suffering from lung diseases - caused by asbestos the company once made - receive compensation. The move follows angry protests after the firm said a previous compensation fund was running out of money. A subsequent New South <i>Wales</i> state inquiry criticised Hardie&#x27;s actions. In September, the inquiry found that the company had misled the public about the amount of money set aside to cover its asbestos-related liabilities, sparking the resignation of its then chief executive, Peter MacDonald.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Campaigners welcomed news of the preliminary agreement. &quot;This is a momentous day in the fight for victims and their families,&quot; said asbestosis sufferer Bernie Banton, who leads a victims&#x27; association. &quot;There is still a long way to go, but we are getting there.&quot; James Hardie chairwoman, Meredith Hellicar, said the deal provided for a funding arrangement &quot;that is affordable, sensible and workable&quot;. &quot;At the end of the day we are dealing with compensation for people who are terminally ill. We don&#x27;t know exactly how many of them there will be, we don&#x27;t know over what exact period they will fall ill,&quot; she said. However, the deal still has to receive the approval of Hardie&#x27;s shareholders.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Hardie, which currently makes more than 80% of its revenues in the US, was once Australia&#x27;s biggest supplier of asbestos building materials. In 2001, the company set up a fund to compensate asbestos victims, but it later admitted the fund was running short of money. A decision by Hardie to move its headquarters to the Netherlands - while remaining a listed company in Australia - provoked a damaging public outcry. Victims groups accusing it of trying to escape its responsibilities by moving abroad, a charge the company denies. Australia&#x27;s securities watchdog is currently investigating Hardie&#x27;s former chief executive and former chief financial officer over allegations of misleading investors and the general public.</p>
