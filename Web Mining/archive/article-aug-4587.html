					<b>McIlroy wins 800m indoor title</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>James McIlroy motored to the AAA&#x27;s Indoor 800m title in Sheffied on Sunday in a time of one minute, 47.97 seconds.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Larne athlete dominated the race from start to finish although he had to hold off a late challenge from Welshman Jimmy Watkins in the final 100 metres. &quot;I had to go out and go through all the gears before the Europeans and I won&#x27;t run again until then,&quot; said McIlroy. &#x27;&#x27;I though if I got lucky I&#x27;d get close to the British record but I blew up in the end.&#x27;&#x27; McIlroy has been in superb form at the start of the season and will now start his build-up for the European Indoors at Madrid on 4-6 March. Meanwhile, Paul Brizzel and Anna Boyle reached the semi-finals of the 60m hurdles with Boyle setting a season&#x27;s best of 7.48. In the women&#x27;s 60m final, Ailis McSweeney broke Michelle Carroll&#x27;s long-standing Irish record by clocking 7.37 which left her in third place. David Gillick showed that he is a genuine medal contender in the European Indoor Championships by claiming an impressive 400m victory. Gillick was more than half-a-second clear when taking gold in 46.45 - .02 outside his personal best set in Saturday&#x27;s semi-finals.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Irishman is now the fastest European this season. Derval O&#x27;Rourke broke her own Irish 60m hurdles record by clocking 8.06 which left her third behind new British record holder Sarah Claxton (7.96). James Nolan (3:46.04) took second in the men&#x27;s 1500m behind Neil Speaight (3:45.86) but the Offaly man was outside the European Indoor standard. Colin Costello was seventh in the 1500m final in 3:48.82). Deirdre Ryan was second in the women&#x27;s high jump with a clearance of 1.87m while Aoife Byrne took silver in the 800m in a personal best of 2:06.73. Lisburn&#x27;s Kelly McNeice Reid (4:31.34) was seventh in the women&#x27;s 1500m while Gary Murray (8:11.22) was 11th in the men&#x27;s 3000m. Meanwhile, Stephen Cairns and Jill Shannon claimed the individual titles at Saturday&#x27;s Northern <i>Ireland</i> Cross Country Championship in Coleraine. Cairns came in ahead of Paul Rowan and Allan Bogle in the men&#x27;s race. Willowfield claimed their first men&#x27;s team title in 72 years while Shannon helped Lagan Valley win the women&#x27;s team honours.</p>
