					<b>Holmes urged to compete at Worlds</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Jolanda Ceplak has urged Britain&#x27;s Kelly Holmes to continue competing at the major championships.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Double Olympic gold medallist Holmes has strongly hinted she will not run in this year&#x27;s Worlds and is undecided about next month&#x27;s European Indoors. But World Indoor 800m record holder Ceplak said: &quot;There is never an easy race when she is in the field. There is only excitement at what might happen. &quot;It is good for the sport. She always fetches the best out of everyone.&quot; Ceplak has been a great rival of Holmes&#x27; during the Briton&#x27;s career and the pair fell out when Holmes questioned the manner of the Slovenian&#x27;s runaway 800m victory at the 2002 European Championships. But the controversy has since been forgotten, with Ceplak acting as pacemaker for Holmes&#x27; failed attempt on the British Indoor 1500m record at the Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham in 2003.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ceplak added: &quot;I like running against her - you know the race is always going to be fast. &quot;That is the sort of competition that I like. She is special to me. She was like my idol from the beginning of my career.&quot; Meanwhile, Ceplak will be looking to follow up last Saturday&#x27;s win in Boston with a fast time and victory in Friday&#x27;s Night of Athletics in Erfurt, Germany. Britain&#x27;s Jason Gardener had been expected to defend his 60m title in Erfurt but instead he will save himself for a competition in Leipzig on Sunday. Gardener&#x27;s decision means Scotland&#x27;s 400m man Ian Mackie will carry British hopes in what looks sure to be a tough preparation for next weekend&#x27;s Norwich Union European trials in Sheffield.</p>
