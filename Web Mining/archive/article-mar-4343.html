			<p>Daniela Hantuchova moved into the quarter-finals of the Dubai Open, after beating Elene Likhotseva of Russia 7-5 6-4, and now faces Serena Williams.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Australian Open champion Williams survived an early scare to beat Russia&#x27;s Elena Bovina 1-6 6-1 6-4. World number one Lindsay Davenport and Anastasia Myskina also progressed. Davenport defeated China&#x27;s Jie Zheng 6-2 7-5, while French Open champion Myskina sailed through after her opponent Marion Bartoli retired hurt. American Davenport will now face fellow former Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martinez of Spain, who ousted seventh-seeded Nathalie Dechy of France 6-1 6-2. Myskina will face eighth-seed Patty Schnyder from Switzerland, who defeated China&#x27;s Li Na 6-3 7-6 (10-8). The other quarter final pits wild card Sania Mirza of India against Jelena Jankovic of Serbia and Montenegro, who both won on Tuesday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Before her meeting with Martinez, Davenport believes there is some room for improvement in her game. &quot;I started well and finished well, but played some so-so games in the middle,&quot; she said. Williams was also far from content. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I was doing there,&quot; she said. &quot;It was really windy and I hadn&#x27;t played in the wind. All my shots were going out of here.&quot; But Hantuchova is in upbeat mood ahead of her clash with the younger Williams sister, who was handed a first-round bye. &quot;I feel I have an advantage (over Serena) because I have already played two matches on these courts,&quot; she said. &quot;It is a difficult court to play on. Very fast and sometimes you feel you have no control over the ball.&quot;</p>
