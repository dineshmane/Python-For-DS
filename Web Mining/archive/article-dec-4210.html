					<p>Unclear future for striker Baros</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Liverpool forward Milan Baros is uncertain whether he remains part of boss Rafa Benitez&#x27;s plans after being dropped for the Carling Cup final.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Baros, who is Liverpool&#x27;s leading scorer this season, denied reports of a row with Benitez but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench. He told Czech newspaper Daily Sport: &quot;I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t play on Sunday. I didn&#x27;t argue with anybody. &quot;I was disappointed but I am not thinking of leaving right now.&quot; The Czech international came on as a substitute after 74 minutes but could not prevent his side losing 3-2 to Chelsea after extra-time.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Baros denied suggestions he wanted to leave the Millennium Stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting line-up. But his admission that he &quot;guessed something like this was going to happen on Saturday&quot;, will do little to quell claims of a falling-out with Benitez. And although Baros insisted thoughts of quitting Anfield are &quot;not in my mind right now&quot;, he admitted &quot;everything is possible&quot;.</p>
