		<h2>Jobs growth still slow in the US</h2>
					<p>Jobs growth still slow in the US</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>According to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January. The gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. The job gains mean that President Bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November&#x27;s Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. As a result, job creation became a key issue in last year&#x27;s election. However, when adding December and January&#x27;s figures, the administration&#x27;s first term jobs record ended in positive territory.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. &quot;It suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,&quot; said Rick Egelton, deputy chief economist at BMO Financial Group. &quot;We are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.&quot; &quot;The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,&quot; said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. &quot;That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.&quot;</p>
