		<h2>Connors&#x27; rallying cry for British tennis</h2>
					<p>Connors&#x27; rallying cry for British tennis</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Do you have it in your heart? How much guts do you have? How much do you hate to lose?&quot;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>These are the questions Jimmy Connors will be asking of Britain&#x27;s brightest tennis hopes in the months, and possibly years, to come. The American legend swept into London on Thursday to announce a &quot;long-term&quot; relationship with the Lawn Tennis Association after spending three days at the Elite Performance winter camp in La Manga. And the man who epitomised the phrase &#x27;will to win&#x27; before Lleyton Hewitt was even born is clear about the qualities he hopes to convey. &quot;You know, everybody hits the ball well and there&#x27;s a very fine line between number one and number 100,&quot; said Connors. &quot;I was that fine line for a long time. But if I can help, I want to be part of teaching kids how to win.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Connors is not the first great name to offer his services to the LTA - his long-time rival John McEnroe has repeatedly done the same. But Connors is at pains to point out that his interest goes well beyond any publicity stunt, and he gave a glowing recommendation to the work of LTA performance director David Felgate and his team. &quot;Britain has a different attitude, the right attitude, in taking the game forward and finding the next Wimbledon champion,&quot; said Connors. &quot;That&#x27;s something you don&#x27;t find every day. Everybody talks a good game but not everybody puts that into effect. &quot;The impression I came away with after just seeing David and the other coaches for three days was one like I&#x27;ve never seen before, especially over here. &quot;This is not going to happen overnight, there are no miracle workers, but you&#x27;re going in the right direction.&quot; The 52-year-old&#x27;s enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis officials back in America. &quot;I&#x27;ve had discussions with the USTA (United States Tennis Association) over a number of years,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#x27;s where it (my input) ended.&quot; Connors is a straight-talker and will be equally blunt and honest in his dealings with the LTA and the cream of Britain&#x27;s young players. &quot;If they&#x27;re chosen, they&#x27;ve got to produce,&quot; he said.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;If not, someone will come and take their place. There&#x27;s only one number one spot and it&#x27;s lonely up there, but it&#x27;s got the best view.&quot; In the year that has seen Andrew Murray emerge as Britain&#x27;s great new hope, Connors rejected suggestions that the Scot might be put under too much pressure too soon. &quot;Tim Henman has a whole country on his shoulder,&quot; said Connors. &quot;I don&#x27;t know that pressure, but if you like that it can be a certain push to get on to the next level. &quot;Someone&#x27;s going to have to come and take over from him (Henman). If I was Andrew Murray, I&#x27;d embrace that. That&#x27;s what we play for.&quot; Despite the emphasis on hard work, training and preparation, Connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within. &quot;The passion I had, I don&#x27;t know if you can find that,&quot; he admitted. &quot;I was also nuts. I say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court. &quot;It was the most important thing in the world for me, and to do that something&#x27;s got to be not right with you. There was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of 25,000 people. &quot;What I had when I played tennis is what I am. You have to have that, you can&#x27;t be moulded.&quot;</p>
