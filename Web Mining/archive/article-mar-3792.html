					<p>Redknapp poised for Saints</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Southampton are set to unveil Harry Redknapp as their new manager at a news conference at 1500 GMT on Wednesday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The former Portsmouth boss replaces Steve Wigley, who has been relieved of first-team duties after just one win in 14 league games in charge. Redknapp, 57, quit his Fratton Park position on 24 November and vowed: &quot;I will not go down the road - no chance.&quot; Pompey coach Kevin Bond is poised to join Redknapp, who will be Saints&#x27; third boss of the season. Redknapp&#x27;s first game in charge will be at home to Middlesbrough on Saturday. Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandaric said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; by the news and claimed Redknapp had been in talks with Southampton for &quot;some time&quot;.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;It would appear that negotiations over this have been going on for some time,&quot; Mandaric said on Portsmouth&#x27;s official website. &quot;I am surprised and a little shocked that the chairman of Southampton has not picked up the phone and kept me informed.&quot; According to Mandaric, Redknapp vowed he would not join their South coast rivals when he left Portsmouth. &quot;I said to Harry &#x27;I hope you don&#x27;t go to Southampton&#x27;, and he told me &#x27;absolutely not&#x27;,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m bitter, disgusted or angry, just disappointed, but it&#x27;s Harry&#x27;s life and it&#x27;s his decision.&quot; Redknapp became a cult hero after leading Portsmouth into the Premiership for the first time, and then masterminding their survival in their debut season. But he left the club claiming he needed a break from football, though many believed he was upset with Mandaric&#x27;s decision to bring in Velimir Zajec as executive director.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe was desperate to give former academy director Wigley, who replaced Paul Sturrock just two games into the season, every chance to succeed at St Mary&#x27;s. But results under Wigley have been poor and Southampton are deep in trouble near the foot of the table. When Redknapp&#x27;s appointment is confirmed, he will be Saints&#x27; ninth manager in eight years.</p>
