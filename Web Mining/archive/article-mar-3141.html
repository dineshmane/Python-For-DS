					<p>Arnesen denies rift with Santini</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Tottenham sporting director Frank Arnesen has denied that coach Jacques Santini resigned because of a clash of personalities at White Hart Lane.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>There had been newspaper speculation that Santini had felt undermined by Arnesen&#x27;s role at the club. &quot;It is absolutely not true,&quot; Arnesen told Online News Radio Five Live. &quot;There is only one thing that made him resign and that is his own personal problems. &quot;He has talked to me recently and said this matter is absolutely for himself.&quot; Arnesen said he was unable to throw any light onto the problems that caused Santini to quit after just 13 games in charge. He added: &quot;Jacques has never gone into exactly what it was. But I trust him in that; you have to accept it. I think we should respect it.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The plan is now that over the weekend we will have talks with the board and then on Monday we will clarify the situation.&quot; Arnesen countered criticism at the timing of the announcement, coming less than 24 hours before Tottenham&#x27;s Premiership fixture with Charlton. &quot;When it comes down to personal problems, I don&#x27;t think we should talk about timing,&quot; he said. And he also denied reports that Santini had been given a Â£3m pay-off. &quot;That is absolute nonsense. He is the one who said &#x27;I will go&#x27; and so he went&#x27;&quot;, said the Spurs sporting director. Tottenham&#x27;s structure of having a sporting director working alongside a coach is based on a continental model and Arnesen sees no reason why they should change it.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>&quot;I have confidence in this structure. I am confident that we have started something here in July and I still have a lot of confidence in Tottenham and what we are doing,&quot; he said. However, former Spurs and <i>England</i> defender Gary Stevens said he would not be surprised if the system had caused a rift. &quot;I think the problems go a lot deeper, between the director of football at White Hart Lane and Santini,&quot; Stevens told Five Live. &quot;On paper they could have worked together. But Frank Arnesen was a very creative, forward-thinking and expansive player - whereas I think Santini was very much the opposite, more a case of being organised, disciplined and happy not conceding goals. &quot;That sort of arrangement can work if the two people have the same principles and ideals and work very closely. But it seems that has not happened.&quot;</p>
