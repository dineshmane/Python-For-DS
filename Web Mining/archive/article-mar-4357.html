			<p>US industrial production increased in December, according to the latest survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM).</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Its index of national manufacturing activity rose to 58.6 last month from 57.8 in November. A reading above 50 indicates a level of growth. The result for December was slightly better than analysts&#x27; expectations and the 19th consecutive expansion. The ISM said the growth was driven by a &quot;significant&quot; rise in the new orders. &quot;This completes a strong year for manufacturing based on the ISM data,&quot; said chairman of the ISM&#x27;s survey committee. &quot;While there is continuing upward pressure on prices, the rate of increase is slowing and definitely trending in the right direction.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The ISM&#x27;s index of national manufacturing activity is compiled from monthly responses of purchasing executives at more than 400 industrial companies, ranging from textiles to chemicals to paper, and has now been above 50 since June 2003. Analysts expected December&#x27;s figure to come in at 58.1. The ISM manufacturing index&#x27;s main sister survey - the employment index - eased to 52.7 in December from 57.6 in November, while its &quot;prices paid&quot; index, measuring the cost to businesses of their inputs, also eased to 72.0 from 74.0. The ISM&#x27;s &quot;new orders&quot; index rose to 67.4 from 61.5.</p>
