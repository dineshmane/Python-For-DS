		<h2>China had role in Yukos split-up</h2>
					<p>China had role in Yukos split-up</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>China lent Russia $6bn (Â£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it has been revealed.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China&#x27;s CNPC.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>According to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk&#x27;s former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. &quot;The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,&quot; said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. &quot;There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country&#x27;s richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China&#x27;s desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China&#x27;s thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. &quot;Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],&quot; said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. &quot;They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies.&quot; &quot;If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,&quot; Mr Lukashov continued. &quot;And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it&#x27;s a good deal for them too.&quot;</p>
