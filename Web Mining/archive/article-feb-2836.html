		<h2>Juninho demand for O&#x27;Neill talks</h2>
					<b>Juninho demand for O&#x27;Neill talks</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Juninho&#x27;s agent has confirmed that the player is hoping for talks with Martin O&#x27;Neill as the Brazilian midfielder comes closer to departing Celtic.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Brian Hassell says no official approach has been received from Manchester City but that the English club had been earmarked as a possible destination. But it was being stressed to Online News Sport that Juninho would prefer to remain with the Scottish champions. Juninho wants assurances that he will return to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s first-team plans. He has become frustrated with his lack of first-team action since his move from Middlesbrough in the summer. Hassel says Juninho, who has just bought a new home, would &quot;desperately like to stay at Celtic&quot; but will seek a move if it is made clear that he is not wanted.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The agent also stressed that nothing should be read into the 30-year-old&#x27;s father being in <i>Scotland</i> and talk of a move back to Botafogo in Brazil. Juninho&#x27;s father was simply in the country to see his son and grandchildren. &quot;I know there is interest from a Brazilian club, but I know Juninho doesn&#x27;t want to go there,&quot; said Hassel. &quot;He wants to stay in Britain. In fact, he wants to stay at Celtic.&quot; Hassall made it clear that a move to Manchester City, who are badly in need of a midfield play-maker, was more of a possibility than Botafogo, or Mexican outfit Red Sharks Veracruz, who also expressed an interest. &quot;It was a thought at one stage,&quot; he said. &quot;If you are not going to get a game under one manager, you look for another whose style of play suits you. &quot;He is a fan of Kevin Keegan&#x27;s style of play. It would not be a bad move for him.&quot; Juninho had earlier told the Daily Record: &quot;The manager has had a lot of chances to put me in his team but it hasn&#x27;t happened. &quot;If that is the case then this is the opportunity for me to go. That would be good for the club and good for me. &quot;If I have no part in his plans, there is no point in remaining here waiting for a chance that never comes.&quot; The attacking midfielder also claims he has not had the backing of boss Martin O&#x27;Neill since his move to Celtic Park. &quot;I can&#x27;t understand why I am in this situation,&quot; he continued. &quot;When a manager brings a new player to the club, he gives that player support.&quot;</p>
