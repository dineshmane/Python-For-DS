		<h2>Moya emotional after Davis Cup win</h2>
					<b>Moya emotional after Davis Cup win</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Carlos Moya described Spain&#x27;s Davis Cup victory as the highlight of his career after he beat Andy Roddick to end the USA&#x27;s challenge in Seville.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Moya made up for missing Spain&#x27;s 2000 victory through injury by beating Roddick 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead. &quot;I have woken up so many nights dreaming of this day,&quot; said Moya. &quot;All my energy has been focused on today. &quot;What I have lived today I do not think I will live again.&quot; Spain&#x27;s only other Davis Cup title came two years ago in Valencia, when they beat Australia. And Moya, nicknamed Charly, admitted: &quot;The Davis Cup is my dream and I was a bit nervous at the outset. &quot;Some people have said that I am obsessed but I think that it is better this way. It helps me reach my goals if I am obsessed. &quot;It&#x27;s really incredible - to get the winning point is really something.&quot; Spanish captain Jordi Arrese said: &quot;Charly played a great game. It was his opportunity and he hasn&#x27;t let us down. &quot;He had lost three times to Roddick, and this was his day to beat him. &quot;He had been waiting years to be in this position.&quot; Spain&#x27;s victory was also remarkable for the performance of Rafael Nadal, who beat Roddick in the opening singles.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Aged 18 years and 185 days, the Mallorcan became the youngest player to win the Davis Cup. &quot;What a great way to finish the year,&quot; said Nadal afterwards. US coach Patrick McEnroe wants Roddick and the rest of his team to play more tennis on clay and hone their skills on the surface. &quot;I think it will help these guys even on slow hard courts to learn how to mix things up a little bit and to play a little bit smarter and tactically better.&quot; &quot;Obviously it&#x27;s unrealistic to say that we&#x27;re going to just start playing constantly on clay, with the schedule. &quot;But certainly I think we can put the work in at the appropriate time and play a couple more events and play against these guys who are the best on this stuff,&quot; said McEnroe. Roddick was left frustrated after losing both his singles on the slow clay of Seville&#x27;s Olympic Stadium. &quot;It&#x27;s just tough because I felt like I was in it the whole time against one of the top three clay-courters in the world,&quot; said the American. &quot;I had my chances and just didn&#x27;t convert them. The bottom line is they were just better than us this weekend. &quot;They came out, took care of business and they beat us. It&#x27;s as simple as that.&quot;</p>
