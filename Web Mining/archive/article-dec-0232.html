					<b>Irish markets reach all-time high</b><br><br>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Irish shares have risen to a record high, with investors persuaded to buy into the market by low inflation and strong growth forecasts.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The ISEQ index of leading shares closed up 23 points to 6661.89 on Thursday, fuelled by strong growth in banking and financial stocks. A fall in the rate of inflation to 2.3% in January gave a fresh boost to shares which have advanced 4% this month. The economy is set for strong growth in 2005 while interest rates remain low.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Several of Ireland&#x27;s biggest companies saw their market value hit recent highs on Thursday. Allied Irish Banks, Ireland&#x27;s biggest company by capitalisation, touched a five year peak while Bank of <i>Ireland</i> shares rose to their highest level since August 2002.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Telecoms firm Eircom, which recently revealed that it would re-enter the Irish mobile phone market, hit a yearly high. Analysts said that economic conditions were benign and Irish shares were still trading at a discount to other European markets. &quot;Ireland ticks all the boxes as far as international investors are concerned,&quot; Roy Asher, chief investment officer of Hibernian Investment Managers, told Online News. &quot;Buoyant economic conditions are set to continue in <i>Ireland</i> over the next few years and Irish equities continue to offer quality growth at a reasonable valuation.&quot;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Bernard McAlinden, head of equity research at NCB Stockbrokers, said equities represented good value compared to other investments. &quot;It is still looking good,&quot; he told Online News. &quot;We have seen good economic data on <i>Ireland</i> which benefits the financial stocks.&quot; Ireland&#x27;s economic &#x27;miracle&#x27; is enjoying a second wind, with 5% growth forecast for 2005 and 2006. The economy cooled markedly between 2001 and 2003 after enjoying spectacular growth of more than 10% in 2000. However, it has bounced back strongly with growth of just under 5% expected in 2004.</p>
