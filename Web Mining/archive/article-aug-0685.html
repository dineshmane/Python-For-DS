					<p>Japanese growth grinds to a halt</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Growth in Japan evaporated in the three months to September, sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Output in the period grew just 0.1%, an annual rate of 0.3%. Exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. The growth falls well short of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. One result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made Japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery. But high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the US are becoming relatively more expensive.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year. The first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the second showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around. &quot;Exports slowed while capital spending became weaker,&quot; said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at UBS Securities in Tokyo. &quot;Personal consumption looks good, but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the Olympics. &quot;The amber light is flashing.&quot; The government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with Japan&#x27;s massive public debt.</p>
