					<b>Relay squad thrilled with honours</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Jason Gardener says being made an MBE in the New Year Honours List underlines the achievement of Great Britain&#x27;s 4x100m relay squad at the Olympics.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Gardener, Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis have all been awarded MBEs after beating pre-race favourites USA to gold. &quot;I think this award reinforces what we did on that fantastic night,&quot; he said. &quot;This recognition is really inspiring and makes me want to have more success,&quot; said Lewis-Francis. The British sprint quartet produced a string of faultless baton changes in the final to put pressure on the Americans.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>And when the USA stumbled with a poor switch between Justin Gatlin and Coby Miller at the 300m stage, Britain edged ahead going into the final bend. Then, on cue, Lewis-Francis ran a textbook final leg, holding off Maurice Greene to bring Team GB home in 38.07 seconds - just one hundredth of a second ahead of their rivals. &quot;Winning the gold medal was the highlight of my athletics career so far,&quot; said the Birchfield Harrier. &quot;This award is not just for me, but for all my friends, family and the people who have helped me to get to this level in my sport.&quot; Gardener added: &quot;All of us had worked very hard for a long, long time to carry off what most believed was an impossible task. &quot;Of course this award is very special, but for me nothing will ever take away winning an Olympic gold medal. It&#x27;s all I ever wanted. &quot;All my life that is what I dreamed of doing. Life since then has been fantastic.&quot; Campbell agreed receiving the honour capped off what has been a difficult year for the sprinter. &quot;I think the MBE is important because the people closest to me know my journey,&quot; said the Newport-based athlete. &quot;I&#x27;ve not just stumbled upon this. &quot;It gives me a lot of joy and satisfaction to know the stuff you do for your country does mean something.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>- There was also recognition for James Clarke, chairman of the London Marathon. He becomes an OBE.</p>
