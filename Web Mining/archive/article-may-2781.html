		<h2>Lomu relishing return to action</h2>
					<b>Lomu relishing return to action</b><br><br>

			<p>Former All Black star Jonah Lomu says he cannot wait to run out on the pitch for former <i>England</i> rugby union captain Martin Johnson&#x27;s testimonial on 4 June.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 29-year-old had a kidney transplant in July 2004 but will play his first full match for three years, leading a southern hemisphere side at Twickenham. &quot;I actually started training three weeks after my operation but I was very limited until a few months ago. &quot;Now it&#x27;s basically bring it on!&quot; said the giant winger. &quot;The match on 4 June will be my first 15-man game but I have a training schedule which is quite testing and combines with sevens and a whole lot of things,&quot; said Lomu. &quot;I have got so much energy since my operation that I train three times a day, six days a week.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Mohammed Ali has always been my ideal. Coming back to rugby, people said &#x27;you are dreaming&#x27; but it always starts off with a dream. &quot;It&#x27;s up to you whether you want to make it a reality.&quot; Opinion has been divided on whether Lomu should attempt to return to the game after such a major operation. But when Lomu was asked whether he was taking a risk he replied: &quot;As much as someone going down the road being hit by a bus. &quot;There are a lot of people in the world with one kidney who just don&#x27;t know it. &quot;I have talked this over, had a chat with the donor and this is to set my soul at peace and finish something I started in 1994 [when he made his All Blacks debut].&quot; At his lowest ebb Lomu was so ill he could barely walk, but he says he is now getting stronger every day and his long-term target is to play for New Zealand again. &quot;The only person who saw me at my worst was my wife,&quot; he added. &quot;I used to take two steps and fall over but now I can run and it is all coming back, and a lot more quickly than I ever thought it would. &quot;To play for the All Blacks would be the highest honour I could get. That is the long-term goal and you have to start somewhere.&quot;</p>
