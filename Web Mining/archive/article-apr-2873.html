					<b>Classy Henman makes winning start</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Tim Henman opened his 2005 campaign with a 6-1 7-5 victory over Argentine David Nalbandian at the Kooyong Classic exhibition tournament on Wednesday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The British number one will next play Roger Federer at the Australian Open warm-up event on Friday. The world number one beat Gaston Gaudio 5-7 6-1 6-4, before Andre Agassi saw off Chilean Olympic gold medalist Nicolas Massu 6-1 7-6 (7-4). Andy Roddick beat Ivan Ljubicic, who replaced Paradorn Srichaphan, 6-1 6-4. Henman made an impressive start to the year, only faltering against Nalbandian when serving for the match at 5-4. But the Briton regained his composure to win the next two games for only his second win in six matches against the Argentine. &quot;It&#x27;s a great start to the year - just what I was looking for,&quot; Henman told his website. &quot;Over the years I&#x27;ve found David very difficult to play against.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;He returns serve very well and he&#x27;s deceptively effective from the baseline, so sometimes it can be difficult to execute my gameplan well enough against him to get the right result. &quot;Beating somebody of his stature is always good for the confidence and it bodes well at the beginning of the year.&quot; Henman also revealed the extent of the back problems he suffered in the off-season. &quot;I&#x27;m not the most flexible and at the end of the year I was pretty exhausted and wanted to have a couple of weeks where I didn&#x27;t do anything,&quot; said Henman. &quot;When I started training again it really, really seized up. As much as I enjoyed the two weeks off I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s so productive.&quot; Federer dropped a tight first set against 2004 French Open champion Gaudio, but was content with his game. &quot;It was about getting used to the surface,&quot; he said.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The conditions are much quicker than Doha, my timing was OK, but I could have served better. &quot;All in all I&#x27;m happy with the match, and I won it - that&#x27;s a good sign. Now I have a day off and hopefully play better the next match.&quot; Agassi was delighted with victory over Massu in his first match for over two months. &quot;I felt pretty good,&quot; said the American. &quot;I liked the way the match played out and, maybe excluding a few second serve returns, I felt like I was doing most things pretty darn well for the first match.&quot;</p>
