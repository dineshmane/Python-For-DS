					<p>Georgia plans hidden asset pardon</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Georgia is offering a one-off &#x27;tax amnesty&#x27; to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president Eduard Shevardnadze.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The country&#x27;s new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax. The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgia&#x27;s flagging economy. Georgia&#x27;s black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Mr Saakashvili, elected president in January after Mr Shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the Georgian Parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. It is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the Shevardnadze era, and boost Georgia&#x27;s fragile public finances.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January, three days before President Saakashvili was elected. &quot;There are people who have money but are afraid to show it,&quot; the president told a government session. &quot;Documentation about where this money came from doesn&#x27;t exist because under the former, entirely warped regime, earning capital honestly was not possible.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>By declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax, people would be able to &quot;legalise their property&quot;, Mr Saakashvili stressed.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;No one will have the right to check this money&#x27;s origin. This money must go back into the economy.&quot; The amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. Criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of Georgian businesses -are to continue. Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in November, of allowing bribery to flourish. Georgia&#x27;s economy is in a desperate condition. Half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $4, or three euros, a day. The unemployment rate is around 20% while the country has a $1.7bn public debt.</p>
