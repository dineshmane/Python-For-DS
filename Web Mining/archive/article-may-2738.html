					<p>AstraZeneca hit by drug failure</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Shares in Anglo-Swedish drug have closed down 8% in UK trade after the failure of its Iressa drug in a major clinical trial.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The lung cancer drug did not significantly prolong survival in patients with the disease. This setback for the group follows the rejection by the US in October of its anti-coagulant pill Exanta. Meanwhile, another of its major money spinners - cholesterol drug Crestor - is facing mounting safety concerns. &quot;This would be two of the three blockbuster drugs that were meant to power the company forward failing... and we&#x27;ve got risks on Crestor,&quot; said Nick Turner, analyst at brokers Jefferies.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>AstraZeneca had hoped to pitch its Iressa drug against rival medicine Tarceva. But Iressa proved no better than a placebo in extending lives in the trial involving 1,692 patients. Tarceva - made by OSI Pharmaceuticals, Genentech and Roche - has already proved to be successful in helping prolong the life of lung cancer patients. AztraZeneca has now appointed a new executive director to the board. John Patterson will be in charge of drug development. The company said Mr Patterson would make &quot;substantial changes to the clinical organisation and its processes&quot;. &quot;I am determined to improve our development and regulatory performance, restore confidence in the company and value to shareholders,&quot; said chief executive Tom McKillop.</p>
