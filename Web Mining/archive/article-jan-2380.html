					<p>Moyes U-turn on Beattie dismissal</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Everton manager David Moyes will discipline striker James Beattie after all for his headbutt on Chelsea defender William Gallas.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Scot initially defended Beattie, whose dismissal put Everton on the back foot in a game they ultimately lost 1-0, saying Gallas overreacted. But he has had a rethink after looking over the video evidence again. He said: &quot;I believe that I should set the record straight by conceding that the dismissal was right and correct.&quot; Moyes added: &quot;My comments on Saturday came immediately after the final whistle and at a point when I had only had the opportunity to see one, very quick re-run of the incident.&quot;</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The club website also reported that Beattie, who seemed unrepentant after Saturday&#x27;s match, insisting Gallas &quot;would have stayed down a lot longer&quot; if he had headbutted him, has now apologised. Moyes continued: &quot;Although the incident was totally out of character - James has never even been suspended before in his career - his actions were unacceptable and had a detrimental effect on his team-mates. &quot;James did issue a formal apology to myself, his team-mates and to the Everton supporters immediately after the game and that was the right thing to have done. He will now be subjected to the normal club discipline. &quot;He is a competitive player but a fair player and I know how upset he is by what has happened. However, I must say that I do still believe the Chelsea player in question did go down too easily.&quot; Speaking immediately after the game, Moyes said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think it was a sending-off, I have been a centre-half in my time and I would have been ashamed to have gone down as easily as that.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;Not in a million years would John Terry have gone down in the same way. I have never heard of anybody butting somebody from behind while you are running after them. &quot;What has happened to big, strong centre-halves? I thought it was a push initially and I still don&#x27;t think it was a sending-off.&quot; An angry Beattie initially said: &quot;He (Gallas) would have stayed down a lot longer if I had headbutted him. &quot;I can tell you it wasn&#x27;t an intentional headbutt. We were chasing a ball into the corner and William Gallas was looking over his shoulder and blocking me off. &quot;He was stopping as we were running and I said to myself &#x27;if you&#x27;re going to stay in my way I&#x27;ll go straight over you&#x27;. Our heads barely touched and it wasn&#x27;t an intentional headbutt.&quot;</p>
