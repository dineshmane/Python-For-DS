		<h2>Linesman defends disallowed goal</h2>
					<b>Linesman defends disallowed goal</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Linesman Rob Lewis has defended his role in Tottenham&#x27;s disallowed goal against Manchester United.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Pedro Mendes&#x27; shot clearly crossed the line and Lewis has been criticised for his positioning in the incident. Lewis said: &quot;The Spurs player shot from distance and I was doing my primary job which was to stand in line with the last defender and watch for an offside. &quot;There was nothing I could have done differently apart from run faster than Linford Christie.&quot; He added: &quot;When the ball landed I was still 25 yards from goal and it was impossible to judge if it had crossed the line.&quot; Tottenham boss Martin Jol criticised the decision, which cost his side three points. &quot;The referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can&#x27;t we just stop the game and get the decision right,&quot; said Jol after the 0-0 draw. &quot;But at the end of the day it&#x27;s so obvious that Pedro&#x27;s shot was over the line it&#x27;s incredible. &quot;We feel robbed but it&#x27;s difficult for the linesman and referee to see it.&quot; Mendes shot from 50 yards and United goalkeeper Roy Carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear. Jol added: &quot;We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. &quot;What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn&#x27;t told about it. &quot;We didn&#x27;t play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.&quot; Mendes could not believe the &#x27;goal&#x27; was not given after seeing a replay.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>He said: &quot;My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. &quot;It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I&#x27;ve never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. &quot;It&#x27;s really, really over. What can you do but laugh about it? It&#x27;s a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn&#x27;t count. &quot;It&#x27;s not every game you score from the halfway line.&quot; Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. &quot;I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that&#x27;s that technology should play a part in the game,&quot; Ferguson told MUTV. &quot;What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. &quot;But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can&#x27;t make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on. &quot;Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn&#x27;t be wasting a lot of time.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.&quot; Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. &quot;When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,&quot; said Wenger. &quot;It&#x27;s a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.&quot;</p>
