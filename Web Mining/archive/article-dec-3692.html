					<b>US company admits Benin bribery</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>A US defence and telecommunications company has agreed to pay $28.5m after admitting bribery in the West African state of Benin.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Titan corporation was accused of funnelling more than $2m into the 2001 re-election campaign of President Mathieu Kerekou. At the time, Titan was trying to get a higher price for a telecommunications project in Benin. There is no suggestion that Mr Kerekou was himself aware of any wrongdoing. Titan, a California-based company, pleaded guilty to falsifying its accounts and violating US anti-bribery laws. It agreed to pay $13m in criminal penalties, as well as $15.5m to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the US financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The SEC had accused Titan of illegally paying $2.1m to an unnamed agent in Benin claiming ties with President Kerekou. Some of the money was used to pay for T-shirts with campaign slogans on them ahead of the 2001 election. Shortly after the poll, which Mr Kerekou won, Benin officials agreed to quadruple Titan&#x27;s management fee. Prosecuting attorney Carol Lam said: &quot;All US companies should take note that attempting to bribe foreign officials is criminal conduct and will be appropriately prosecuted.&quot; The company says it no longer tolerates such practices. Under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, it is a crime for American firms to bribe foreign officials.</p>
