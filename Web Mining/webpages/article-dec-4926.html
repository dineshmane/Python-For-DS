					<b>Japan turns to beer alternatives</b><br><br>

			<p></p>
			<p>Japanese brewers are increasingly making money from beer-flavoured drinks rather than beer itself</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Beer and spirits are heavily taxed in Japan, driving breweries to search for alternatives. Japan&#x27;s long economic downturn helped drive the trend, as drinkers looked for cheaper opportunities to drown their sorrows. Now, according to Asahi Breweries, the market for so-called &quot;beer-like&quot; drinks is set to grow 84% this year.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Asahi is predicting profits to rise 50% in 2005 as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt. The chosen name, &quot;Shinnama&quot; or &quot;new draft&quot;, disguises its non-beer nature. But despite a record profit in 2004 of 30.6bn yen ($291m; Â£154m), up 31.8% on the previous year, Asahi is coming late to the market. Key rival Sapporo is already well-established with the beer-flavoured &quot;Draft One&quot;. Suntory, meanwhile, is doing well with &quot;Super Blue&quot;, which combines happoshu - an existing low-cost beer alternative made with malt and seawater - and shochu, a distilled alcohol derived from sweet potatoes or barley. Happoshu has been a mainstay of brewery profits for years, taking over from beer thanks to its low tax and therefore low cost. Kirin, the fourth big name, is launching its own &quot;third-type&quot; drink in April.</p>
