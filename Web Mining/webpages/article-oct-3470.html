					<b>Double injury blow strikes Wales</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Wales centre Sonny Parker and number eight Ryan Jones will miss Saturday&#x27;s game with Italy because of injury.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Parker has not recovered from a trapped nerve in his neck that kept him out of the win over England, and Tom Shanklin is expected to continue at centre. Jones damaged his collar bone after coming on as a replacement against <i>England</i> and joins flanker Colin Charvis (foot injury) on the sidelines. Meanwhile, Mike Ruddock may make Gavin Henson his first-choice kicker in Rome. The centre was Wales&#x27; hero in the 11-9 Six Nations win over England, landing a huge late penalty from wide out to clinch the game. First-choice kicker Stephen Jones handed over responsibility because of Henson&#x27;s greater kicking range, but the fly-half had already missed a number of shots at goal. &quot;Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but giving him the kicks is something we&#x27;ll talk about in selection this week,&quot; <i>Wales</i> coach Mike Ruddock told Online News Sport Wales. Henson himself says he is relishing all the media hype that has been heaped on him since last Saturday&#x27;s game. &quot;I thrive on it and think it makes me perform better,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s a short week before the Italy game. There was so much build-up before England, but we fly out to Rome on Thursday and we&#x27;ll be back playing again.&quot;</p>
