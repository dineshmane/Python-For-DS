					<p>Aragones angered by racism fine</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Spain coach Luis Aragones is furious after being fined by The Spanish Football Federation for his comments about Thierry Henry.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 66-year-old criticised his 3000 euros (£2,060) punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty. &quot;I am not guilty, nor do I accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m not a racist and I&#x27;ve never lacked sporting decorum. I&#x27;ve never done that and I have medals for sporting merit.&quot; Aragones was handed the fine on Tuesday after making racist remarks about Henry to Arsenal team-mate and Spanish international Jose Reyes last October.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Spanish Football Federation at first declined to take action against Aragones, but was then requested to do so by Spain&#x27;s anti-violence commission. The fine was far less than the expected amount of about £22,000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who was fined £15,000 in December for accusing Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of cheating, believes that Aragones&#x27; punishment was too lenient. &quot;You compare his fine and my fine, and if you consider his was for racist abuse, then you seem to get away with it more in Spain than you should,&quot; Wenger said. &quot;He shouldn&#x27;t have said what he said, and how much money is enough, I don&#x27;t know but it doesn&#x27;t look a big punishment.&quot; However, Aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair. &quot;I have been treated like Islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter Manolete),&quot; said Aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions. &quot;I have not liked one thing about this whole affair and I do not agree with the sanction. They have looked for a scapegoat.&quot; Spain&#x27;s anti-violence commission must now ratify the Spanish FA&#x27;s decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. Aragones has 10 days to appeal, and the commission can also appeal. Alberto Flores, president of the Spanish FA&#x27;s disciplinary committee, said no-one in the committee felt Aragones was a racist nor had &quot;acted in a racist way.&quot; &quot;A fine, the highest we could apply, is sufficient punishment. Suspension would have been a bit exaggerated,&quot; Flores told sports daily Marca.</p>
