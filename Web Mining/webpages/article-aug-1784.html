			<span></span>
			<p>European Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>A levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the world&#x27;s poorest nations. Airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans, saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure. The EU said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines. It was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the &quot;competitiveness of the airlines&quot;. Ministers will also be discussing reforms to regulations governing European public spending.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Global leaders have focused attention on poverty reduction and development at recent meetings of the G7 Group and World Economic Forum. The world&#x27;s richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and <i>Germany</i> following the recent G7 meeting. At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states.</p>
