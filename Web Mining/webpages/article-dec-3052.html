					<b>Saudi NCCI&#x27;s shares soar</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Shares in Saudi Arabia&#x27;s National Company for Cooperative Insurance (NCCI) soared on their first day of trading in Riyadh.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>They were trading 84% above the offer price on Monday, changing hands at 372 riyals ($99; Â£53) after topping 400 early in the day. Demand for the insurer&#x27;s debut shares was strong - 12 times what was on sale. The listing was part of the country&#x27;s plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand in the sector. Deregulation is expected to boost demand for accident and damage cover.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Previously, only NCCI has been legally allowed to offer insurance products within Saudi Arabia. However, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the many other firms selling insurance. Saudi Arabia now wants a fully functioning insurance industry and is introducing legislation that will clamp down on unauthorised companies. Policy-makers also want to make having insurance more of a requirement, but first have to take steps to boost public confidence in the system, analysts said. As a result, NCCI is being developed as the industry&#x27;s flagship firm - publicly-listed, with audited accounts. Saudi Arabia sold 7 million NCCI shares, or about 70% of the company&#x27;s total capital last month. More than 800,000 applicants got 9 shares each for 205 riyals apiece.</p>
