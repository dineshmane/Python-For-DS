			<p></p>
			<p>Richard Dunne is ready to commit his long-term future to Manchester City after turning his career around.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>He was once threatened with the sack by City boss Kevin Keegan but has since responded with impressive performances, prompting interest from other clubs. Early talks have taken place and the defender said: &quot;Hopefully something will be sorted out as soon as possible. &quot;I definitely want to stay at City because I have really improved as a player here.&quot; Newcastle boss Graeme Souness is said to have been impressed enough by Dunne&#x27;s turnaround in form to be ready to make a bid for the big stopper in the January transfer window. But the 25-year-old Dubliner underlined his intention to stay at Eastlands. He added: &quot;It&#x27;s nice to be linked with top clubs but the important thing is this one and what we do. &quot;I really enjoy it at City and I want to keep that going.&quot; Keegan is expected to be told there will be no funds to bring in fresh faces in January. Dunne&#x27;s professionalism was famously questioned by Keegan, who ordered the defender home after he allegedly turned up for training in a dishevelled state.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But Dunne is keen to put that period of his life behind him and said: &quot;I&#x27;ve grown up a lot and the manager sees me as one of the most experienced players in the squad. &quot;I&#x27;ve played more games than any other outfield players this season so I can&#x27;t be regarded as being a kid any more. &quot;I have to use that as added pressure to perform and apart from the games at Newcastle and Middlesbrough, defensively we&#x27;ve done quite well.&quot; Keegan is set for another boost when goalkeeper Nicky Weaver makes his long-awaited return in a reserve game at Blackburn on Tuesday. Former <i>England</i> Under-21 keeper Weaver has missed nearly three full seasons with a succession of knee injuries, which eventually needed pioneering transplant surgery earlier this year.</p>
