					<b>Wales make two changes for France</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Wales coach Mike Ruddock has made two changes from the team that beat Italy 38-8 for Saturday&#x27;s trip to France.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Kevin Morgan takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague Hal Luscombe on the right wing. And in the pack Neath-Swansea Ospreys forward Ryan Jones is preferred at blindside flanker to Jonathan Thomas. Thomas, a try-scorer in Rome, drops down to the bench instead of Ian Gough, while Cardiff back Rhys Williams steps up in place of Morgan. Luscombe is sidelined by a hamstring problem sustained during the Six Nations game against Italy last weekend.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>However, the experienced and in-form Morgan was already pushing hard for a start at Stade de France. &quot;Due to his impressive performances from the bench, Kevin was very much in the selection mix anyway, and the unfortunate injury to Hal gives him the chance to start,&quot; said Ruddock. &quot;Now that Ryan Jones has recovered from injury, we have increased the options in the back row. &quot;Jonathan Thomas is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against Italy and scoring a try, but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail. &quot;For this particular game, we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against Italy, so an extra big ball-carrier in the back-row is thought to be necessary on this occasion. &quot;Obviously, it&#x27;s a 22-man game these days, and there is every chance that Jonathan will be making an impact from the bench.&quot; Wales have beaten France on two of their last three visits to Paris, and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first Five or Six Nations title triumph since 1994. &quot;Graham Henry (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should &#x27;be bold&#x27; when going to France, and he was proved right,&quot; said Ruddock. &quot;That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>G Thomas (Toulouse, capt); K Morgan (Newport-Gwent), T Shanklin (Cardiff), G Henson (Neath-Swansea), S Williams (Neath-Swansea); S Jones (Clermont Auvergne), D Peel (Llanelli); G Jenkins (Cardiff), M Davies (Gloucester), A Jones; (Neath-Swansea), B Cockbain (Neath-Swansea), R Sidoli (Cardiff); R Jones (Neath-Swansea), M Williams (Cardiff), M Owen (Newport-Gwent).</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Replacements: R McBryde (Llanelli), J Yapp (Cardiff), J Thomas (Neath-Swansea), R Sowden-Taylor (Cardiff), G Cooper (Newport-Gwent), C Sweeney Newport-Gwent), R Williams (Cardiff).</p>
