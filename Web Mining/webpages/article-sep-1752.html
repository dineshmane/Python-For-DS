					<p>Worldcom director ends evidence</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The former chief financial officer at US telecoms firm WorldCom has finished giving evidence at the trial of his ex-boss Bernie Ebbers.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Scott Sullivan admitted to jurors he was willing to commit fraud to meet Wall Street earnings projections. Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom&#x27;s collapse in 2002. He pleads not guilty. Mr Sullivan has spent two days being cross-examined by lawyers for former Worldcom chief executive Mr Ebbers.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Attorney Reid Weingarten has attempted to portray Mr Sullivan as a liar and on Thursday quizzed him about his decision to commit fraud to meet analysts&#x27; profit estimates. &quot;At that point in time,&quot; Mr Sullivan said, referring to the first false entries in late 2000, &quot;I knew it was wrong and I knew it was against the law, but I thought we would get through it in the short term.&quot; Mr Sullivan, 42, has already pleaded guilty to fraud and will be sentenced following Mr Ebbers&#x27; trial, where he is appearing as a prosecution witness. Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom&#x27;s finances. The former finance officer said Mr Ebbers knew about the improper accounting entries that were made between 2000 and 2002 to conceal soaring expenses and inflate revenue.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mr Ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. WorldCom&#x27;s problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies. Prosecutors allege that the company&#x27;s top executives responded by orchestrating massive fraud over a two-year period. WorldCom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as MCI. On Monday, MCI agreed to a buyout by Verizon Communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn.</p>
