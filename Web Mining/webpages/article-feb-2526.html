					<b>Cudicini misses Carling Cup final</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini will miss Sunday&#x27;s Carling Cup final after the club dropped their appeal against his red card against Newcastle.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The Italian was sent off for bringing down Shola Ameobi in the final minute of Sunday&#x27;s match. Blues boss Jose Mourinho had promised to pick Cudicini for the final instead of first-choice keeper Petr Cech. The 31-year-old will now serve a one-match suspension commencing with immediate effect.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Cudicini kept a club record 24 clean sheets last season for Chelsea, but Petr Cech has established himself as first choice for Mourinho since moving to Stamford Bridge in summer 2004. The 22-year-old Czech Republic international has set a new Premiership record of 961 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal, a mark which is still running. But Mourinho has used Cudicini regularly in the Carling Cup, and the Italian has only let in one goal in his four appearances during Chelsea&#x27;s run to the final.</p>
