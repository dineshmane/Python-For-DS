					<p>Argentina closes $102.6bn debt swap</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Argentina is set to close its $102.6bn (Â£53.51bn) debt restructuring offer for bondholders later on Friday, with the government hopeful that most creditors will accept the deal.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The estimated loss to bondholders is up to 70% of the original value of the bonds, yet the majority are expected to accept the government&#x27;s offer. Argentina defaulted on its debt three years ago, the biggest sovereign default in modern history. Yesterday Argentina&#x27;s economy minister, Roberto Lavagna, said that he estimated that the results of the restructuring would be ready around next Thursday (3 March). Argentina&#x27;s President, Nestor Kirchner, said on Friday: &quot;A year ago when we started the swap (negotiations), they told us we were crazy, that we were irrational.&quot; But he added that his government was close to achieving: &quot;The best debt renegotiation in history.&quot; The country has been in default on the $102.6bn - based on an original debt of $81.8bn plus interest - for the past three years. If the offer does not go ahead, international lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved investors could follow but analysts are optimistic that it will go through, despite the tough terms for bondholders. About 70% to 80% of bondholders are expected to accept the terms of the offer. By 18 February, creditors holding $41bn - or 40% of the total debt - had accepted the offer. Sorting out its debt would enhance the country&#x27;s credibility on international markets and enable it to attract more foreign investment. Of Argentina&#x27;s bondholders, 38.4% reside in Argentina, 15.6% in Italy, 10.3% in Switzerland, 9.1% in the United States, 5.1% in <i>Germany</i> and 3.1% in Japan. Investors in the UK, Holland and Luxembourg have about 1% each and the remainder were not broken down by country. The deal is likely to be taken up most enthusiastically by domestic investors, who will benefit if Argentina&#x27;s economy becomes more stable.</p>
