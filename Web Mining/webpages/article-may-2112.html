					<b>Gadget show heralds MP3 season</b><br><br>

			<p>Partners of those who love their hi-tech gear may want to get their presents in early as experts predict a gadget shortage this Christmas.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>With Apple&#x27;s iPod topping wish lists again, there may not be enough iPod minis to go round, predicts Oliver Irish, editor of gadget magazine Stuff. &quot;The iPod mini is likely to be this year&#x27;s Tracey Island,&quot; said Mr Irish. Stuff has compiled a list of the top 10 gadgets for 2004 and the iPod is at number one.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>For anyone bewildered by the choice of gadgets on the market, Stuff and What Hi-Fi? are hosting a best-of gadget show in London this weekend. Star of the show will be Sony&#x27;s Qrio Robot, an all-singing, all-dancing, football-playing man-machine who can even hold intelligent conversations.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But he is not for sale and Sony has no commercial plans for the robot. &quot;He will greet visitors and is flying in from Japan. He probably has his own airplane seat, that is how highly Sony prize him,&quot; said Mr Irish. Also on display will be a virtual keyboard which projects itself onto any flat surface. The event will play host to a large collection of digital music players, from companies such as Creative, Sony and Philips as well as the ubiquitously fashionable iPod from Apple. Suggestions that it could be a gaming or wireless Christmas are unlikely to come true as MP3 players remain the most popular stocking filler, said Mr Irish. &quot;Demand is huge and Apple has promised that it can supply enough but people might struggle to get their hands on iPod minis,&quot; said Mr Irish.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>For those who like their gadgets to be multi-talented, the Gizmondo, a powerful gaming console with GPS and GPRS, that also doubles up as an MP3 player, movie player and camera, could be a must-have. &quot;What is impressive is how much it can do and how well it can do them,&quot; said Mr Irish. This Christmas, gadgets will not be an all-male preserve. &quot;Women will be getting gadgets from husbands and boyfriends as well as buying them for themselves,&quot; said Mr Irish. &quot;Gadgets nowadays are lifestyle products rather than just for geeks.&quot;</p>
