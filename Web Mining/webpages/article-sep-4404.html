					<p>Lions blow to World Cup winners</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>British and Irish Lions coach Clive Woodward says he is unlikely to select any players not involved in next year&#x27;s RBS Six Nations Championship.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>World Cup winners Lawrence Dallaglio, Neil Back and Martin Johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer&#x27;s tour to New Zealand. &quot;I don&#x27;t think you can ever say never,&quot; said Woodward. &quot;But I would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby.&quot; Dallaglio, Back and Johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. But Woodward added: &quot;The key thing that I want to stress is that I intend to use the Six Nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark. &quot;My job, along with all the other senior representatives, is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team. &quot;If you are not playing international rugby then it&#x27;s still a step up to Test rugby. It&#x27;s definitely a disadvantage.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;I think it&#x27;s absolutely critical and with the history of the Lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries.&quot; Woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open. &quot;It is an open book,&quot; he said. &quot;There are some outstanding candidates from all four countries.&quot; And following the All Blacks&#x27; impressive displays in Europe in recent weeks, including a 45-6 humiliation of France, Woodward believes the three-test series in New Zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge. &quot;Their performance in particular against France was simply awesome,&quot; said the Lions coach. &quot;Certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five, but they&#x27;re a very powerful unit.&quot; With his customary thoroughness, Woodward revealed he had taken soundings from Australia coach Eddie Jones and Jake White of South Africa following their tour matches in Britain and Ireland.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>As a result, Woodward stressed his Lions group might not be dominated by players from England and <i>Ireland</i> and held out hope for the struggling Scots. &quot;Scotland&#x27;s recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances. &quot;Eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for Australia and I will take on board their opinions.&quot; And Scotland forward Simon Taylor looks certain to get the call, provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems. &quot;I took lessons from 2001 in that they did make a mistake in taking Lawrence Dallaglio when he wasn&#x27;t fit and went on the trip. &quot;Every player has to be looked at on their own merits and Simon Taylor is an outstanding player and I have no doubts that if he gets back to full fitness he will be on the trip. &quot;I am told he should be back playing by March and he has plenty of time to prove his fitness for the Lions - and there are other players like Richard Hill in the same boat.&quot;</p>
