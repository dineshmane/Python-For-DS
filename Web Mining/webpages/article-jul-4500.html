		<h2>What now for British tennis?</h2>
					<b>What now for British tennis?</b><br><br>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Tim Henman&#x27;s decision to quit Davis Cup tennis has left the British team with a gargantuan void to fill.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The world number seven is tied for fourth among his countrymen for wins in the history of the tournament (he has 36 from his 50 rubbers). And Great Britain&#x27;s last Davis Cup win without Henman came against Slovenia as far back as 1996. Worse could follow, according to former British team member Chris Bailey. Bailey told Online News Sport: &quot;After Tim&#x27;s announcement, I doubt Greg Rusedski will be that far behind him.&quot; But without their top two, where does that leave British ambitions in the sport&#x27;s premier team event? Captain Jeremy Bates has singled out Alex Bogdanovic and Andrew Murray as potential replacements. The Yugoslavian-born Bogdanovic, though, is 184 places below Henman in the world rankings and has played just two cup ties - winning one and losing the other.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Murray, on the other hand, is 407th in the current ATP entry list and yet to make his cup debut. But Bailey does see some hope for the future. He said: &quot;Now we&#x27;ve dropped down to the Euro-Africa zone, the time was right for him to step down and let the young guys come to the fore.&quot; Britain&#x27;s next opponents, Israel, are hardly likely to be quaking in their boots ahead of the 4-6 March match against a likely trio of Bogdanovic, Murray and the 187th-ranked Arvind Parmar. Bailey said: &quot;It will be tough for GB to move up, but there comes a time when our young players have to step up. This was always going to be inevitable with Tim and Greg&#x27;s growing years. &quot;I&#x27;m confident about the future. I wouldn&#x27;t lay money on us getting back into the world group next year, but I&#x27;d imagine in five years time we&#x27;ll be competing for the major honours.&quot; Of those lining up to replace Henman, the 17-year-old Murray, with four Futures titles under his belt last year, looks the best long-term bet. &quot;Murray is the one that looks likeliest to take over Tim&#x27;s mantle,&quot; said Bailey. &quot;He has an enormous amount of self-confidence, judging by what he&#x27;s said in the past.&quot; Bogdanovic, three years Murray&#x27;s senior, has had a more troubled time under Britain&#x27;s Davis Cup umbrella.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>While Murray has been marked out as Britain&#x27;s golden boy, Bogdanovic was warned by the Lawn Tennis Association for a lack of drive at the end of 2003. And Bailey said: &quot;Despite that, Alex is clearly talented as well, while Arvind is another contender. &quot;They&#x27;re among the guys who have experienced the intensity of Davis Cup tennis - whether as players or on the sidelines. &quot;The LTA has always done an exceptional job of ensuring that. &quot;Now they&#x27;ll finally get to play regularly in the cauldron of the cup. And I&#x27;m confident that will springboard Team GB to greater success.&quot;</p>
