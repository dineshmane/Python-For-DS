					<b>GM, Ford cut output as sales fall</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>US car firms General Motors (GM) and Ford have been forced to cut production in the face of falling car sales.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>US sales at GM sank 12.7% in February compared to a year ago while Ford sales dropped 3% as foreign rivals took a bigger share of the market. Meanwhile, Asian carmakers fared well - Toyota sales jumped 11% while rival Nissan notched up a 10% increase. Overall. sales across the industry also fell to 1.25 million vehicles from 1.27 million a year earlier.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>GM and Ford blamed high fuel prices for low sales of big trucks and gas-guzzling sports utility vehicles (SUVs) - the vehicles that provide the biggest profits.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>GM added that US truck sales fell 9% in February while car business tumbled 17%, however it did acknowledge that some new products - such as the Pontiac G6 and Chevrolet Cobalt - had put in solid performances. &quot;The calendar year is starting off slower than expected, both for GM and the industry,&quot; said Mark LaNeve, GM&#x27;s vice president for North American sales, service and marketing. The slump in sales prompted the group to cut production in North America by 3% - it has already reduced output by around 9% in the face of growing stockpiles. Meanwhile, Ford which posted its ninth consecutive drop in monthly US sales, said it was cutting first-quarter North American production by another 10,000 vehicles, or 1.2%. Chrysler, the US unit of Germany&#x27;s DaimlerChrysler, was the only Detroit based automaker to boast an increase in market share during the month - with sales rising 8%.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>But America&#x27;s loss was its foreign rivals&#x27; gain as they continued to nibble away at the US market. While Japan&#x27;s top car maker Toyota and Nissan saw sales accelerate, even the smaller Suzuki Motor Corp snapped up a more business with sales improving 17.6% on a year ago. In 2003, the firm launched an ambitious plan to triple US sales by 2007 as it seeks to become a bigger player in the Asian assault on the US market. Korea&#x27;s Hyundai was another big gainer, turning in a 19% surge in February sales. Toyota put its rise in sales down to strong results for its redesigned Avalon sedan and a 120% surge in sales of its gas-electric Prius hybrid mid-size sedan as petrol-price conscious consumers looked to vehicles that were cheaper to run. &quot;As gas prices continue their upward march, fuel efficiency catches the public eye,&quot; Jim Press, vice president and chief operating officer of Toyota&#x27;s US sales arm, said in a statement.</p>
