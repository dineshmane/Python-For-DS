		<h2>Bell set for England debut</h2>
					<p>Bell set for <i>England</i> debut</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Bath prop Duncan Bell has been added to England&#x27;s 30-man squad to face Ireland in the RBS Six Nations.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>And with Phil Vickery sidelined for at least six weeks with a broken arm and Julian White out with a neck injury, Bell could make his <i>England</i> debut. Bell, 30, had set his sights on an international career with Wales. But last December, the International Rugby Board confirmed that he could only be eligible for <i>England</i> as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. <i>England</i> coach Andy Robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan into his front row. But Sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped Bell - who was among the tryscorers when <i>England</i> A beat France A 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in. Robinson also has an injury worry over centre Olly Barkley, who withdrew from Bath&#x27;s starting line-up to face Gloucester last weekend.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>He was due to have a hospital scan on Monday, while Gloucester centre Henry Paul, who started at fly-half against Bath, limped out at Kingsholm because of an ankle problem. Despite Barkley&#x27;s three missed penalties in the 18-17 defeat against France, he is expected to retain his place at inside centre, although Leicester&#x27;s in-form prospect Ollie Smith would be an obvious replacement. Bath coach John Connolly rates Barkley as no better than a 50/50 chance to make the Dublin trip. Uncapped fly-half Andy Goode has been named in a 30-man training squad for the Ireland game, and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during Leicester&#x27;s record 83-10 win against Newcastle on Sunday. England&#x27;s players are due to meet at their Surrey training base on Monday.</p>
