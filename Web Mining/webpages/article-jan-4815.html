					<p>Ferguson puts faith in youngsters</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said he has no regrets after his second-string side lost 3-0 away at Fenerbahce in the Champions League.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Ferguson said: &quot;The good thing about being manager is that you are in control of which team to pick. &quot;I care about United, that&#x27;s important, so while I am disappointed at the result I am not at the team I selected. &quot;This game was important for the young lads. They will remember it and next time they come they will be better.&quot; Ferguson admitted his side were well-beaten by the Turks, a result which meant they finished second in Group D behind Lyon. He added: &quot;They&#x27;ll know not to play like that again. We showed a lack of strength. But I have no complaints about the scoreline. &quot;In the second half we had some good moments in attack. And in that situation, you have to take one chance. &quot;But we didn&#x27;t do that, so the game just petered out for us. &quot;I didn&#x27;t think it made much difference whether we won the group or finished second and I still don&#x27;t. &quot;We could get Inter, AC Milan and Juventus but Bayern, Barcelona and Real Madrid were among the runners-up. All we can do is let fate decide how it works out.&quot;</p>
