		<h2>UK house prices dip in November</h2>
					<b>UK house prices dip in November</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>UK house prices dipped slightly in November, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) has said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The average house price fell marginally to £180,226, from £180,444 in October. Recent evidence has suggested that the UK housing market is slowing after interest rate increases, and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005. But while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market, annual house price inflation is still strong, up 13.8% in the year to November. Economists, however, forecast that ODPM figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months. &quot;Overall, the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data,&quot; said Mark Miller, at HBOS Treasury Services. &quot;The ODPM data is a fairly lagging indicator.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The figures come after the Bank of <i>England</i> said the number of mortgages approved in the UK has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. The Halifax, meanwhile, said last week that house prices increased by 1.1% in December - the first monthly rise since September.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The UK&#x27;s biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004, but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. It is predicting a 2% fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years. The ODPM attributed the monthly fall of prices in November to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats. It said annual inflation rose between October and November because prices had fallen by 1.1% in the same period in 2003.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The ODPM data showed the average house price was £192,713 in England; £139,544 in Wales; £116,542 in Scotland, and £111,314 in Northern Ireland.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>All areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in November except for Northern <i>Ireland</i> and the West Midlands, where the rate was unchanged, the ODPM said. The North East showed the highest rate of inflation at 26.2%, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber on 21.7%, and the North West on 21.1%. The East Midlands, the West Midlands and the South West all had an annual inflation rate of more than 15%. In London, the area with the highest average house price at £262,825, annual inflation rose only slightly in November to 7.1% from 7% the previous month.</p>
