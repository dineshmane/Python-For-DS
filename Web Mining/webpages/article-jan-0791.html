					<p>Holmes secures comeback victory</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Britain&#x27;s Kelly Holmes marked her first appearance on home soil since winning double Olympic gold with 1500m victory at the Norwich Union International.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Holmes hit the front just before the bell in front of a sell-out crowd in Glasgow and cruised to victory in a time of four minutes 14.74 seconds. &quot;It was nice to get that out of the way. I was nervous about whether I would actually be able to get round. &quot;I felt good. I just had to relax and use my racing knowledge,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It was all about winning in front of my home crowd. The time is irrelevant. &quot;I got round in one piece and didn&#x27;t disgrace myself. Now it&#x27;s about going forward. &quot;The reception I&#x27;ve had since the Olympics has been amazing and that&#x27;s why I wanted to keep running this year, because I get a buzz from the crowd.&quot; Holmes ran a tactically perfect race to finish clear of France&#x27;s Hind Dehiba and Russia&#x27;s Svetlana Cherkasova. The Olympic 800m and 1500m champion&#x27;s time was inside the qualifying mark for the European Indoor Championships in Madrid in March. But the 34-year-old would not reveal whether she intended to run or not, having previously indicated she would leave a decision until after the Birmingham Grand Prix on 18 February.</p>
