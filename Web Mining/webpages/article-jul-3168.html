			<p>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez said their qualification for the next stage of the Champions League was &quot;one of the proudest nights of my career.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The Reds beat Olympiakos 3-1 with a late Steven Gerrard strike and Benitez said: &quot;It was a really great night. &quot;The players ran hard all the time and you see how much it means to the fans. &quot;We knew before the game that it was very important for the club to gain these extra finances. For Liverpool, this result is very, very important.&quot; Benitez hailed Gerrard for his match-winning strike four minutes from time and also the Anfield crowd for sticking by their side after they had fallen a goal behind at the interval. The Reds scored three second-half goals in a sensational comeback capped by Gerrard&#x27;s 20-yard drive. He added: &quot;Steven can play all over the pitch and he influences every part of the game.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I have said to him many times that he has the freedom because he has talent and is very important to us. &quot;I felt that the difference between the sides was really our supporters, I cannot thank them enough. &quot;I want to say thank-you to the supporters, they were magnificent to help us achieve this result.&quot; Gerrard admitted he thought they were going out of the Champions League after trailing 1-0 at half-time. He said: &quot;I&#x27;d be lying if I thought we were going through when we were losing at half-time.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;We had a mountain to climb, but we have climbed it and credit to everyone. &quot;That was one of the best goals I have scored, I caught it sweet, I haven&#x27;t caught one like that for ages. It was a massive night for me and the team.&quot; Liverpool&#x27;s win means all four of England&#x27;s Champions League representatives have reached the knockout stages for the first time.</p>
