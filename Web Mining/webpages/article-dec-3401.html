			<p>World number one Roger Federer added the Dubai Championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by Ivan Ljubicic.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Top seed Federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. But Ljubicic, who beat Tim Henman in the last eight, dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. Swiss star Federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. The match was a re-run of last week&#x27;s final at the World Indoor Tournament in Rotterdam, where Federer triumphed, but not until Ljubicic had stretched him for five sets. &quot;I really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and I did, and I could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm,&quot; Federer said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;That took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and I almost ran away with it. But he came back, and that was a good effort on his side.&quot; Ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set. &quot;I didn&#x27;t start badly, but then suddenly I felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. And with Roger, if you relax for a second it just goes very quick,&quot; he said. &quot;After those first three games it was no match at all. I don&#x27;t know, it was really weird. I was playing really well the whole year, and then suddenly I found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court.&quot; But despite his defeat, the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance. &quot;I had a chance in the third, and for me it&#x27;s really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against Roger to win the match. &quot;It&#x27;s an absolutely great boost to my confidence that I&#x27;m up there and belong with top-class players.&quot;</p>
