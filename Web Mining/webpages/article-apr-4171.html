					<b>Saint-Andre anger at absent stars</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Sale Sharks director of rugby Philippe Saint-Andre has re-opened rugby&#x27;s club-versus-country debate.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Sale host Bath in the Powergen Cup on Friday, but the Frenchman has endured a &quot;difficult week&quot; with six players away on England&#x27;s Six Nations training camp. &quot;It&#x27;s an important game but we&#x27;ve just the one full session. It&#x27;s the same for everyone but we need to manage it. &quot;If five players or more are picked for your country they should move the date of the game,&quot; he told Online News Sport. Unless the authorities agree to make changes, Saint-Andre believes England&#x27;s national team will suffer as clubs opt to sign foreigners and retired internationals. &quot;That&#x27;s not good for the politics of the English team or for English rugby,&quot; he argues. It is an issue he has taken up before, most notably during the autumn internationals when Sale lost all three Zurich Premiership matches they played.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Now he fears it could derail the club&#x27;s hopes of cup silverware after eight players, including captain Jason Robinson and fly-half Charlie Hodgson, were away with their countries. &quot;We&#x27;re in the quarter-finals, it&#x27;s always better to play at home than away and it&#x27;s a great opportunity,&quot; he added. &quot;But we have to be careful. Bath have just been knocked out of Europe and will make it a tough game. It also comes at the end of a very, very difficult week. &quot;Sebastien Bruno&#x27;s been with France, Jason White with <i>Scotland</i> and there are six with England, that&#x27;s eight players plus injuries - 13 players out of a squad of 31. &quot;We&#x27;ll have just one session together and will have to do our best to make that a good one on Thursday afternoon.&quot;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Gloucester have also been caught in a club-versus-country conflict after England sought a second medical opinion on James Simpson-Daniel&#x27;s fitness. The winger is carrying a shoulder injury and the national team management believe he requires time on the sidelines. As a result he misses the Cherry and White&#x27;s quarter-final at home to Bristol. &quot;Under the Elite Player Squad agreement, England wanted a second opinion, which they can do,&quot; director of rugby Nigel Melville told the Gloucester Citizen.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;They obviously want him for international rugby and we want him for club rugby in what is a very important game for us. There is a conflict of interests. &quot;The surgeon who carried out his operation said he was fine for us but England say he is still vulnerable to be damaged again and want him on a full rehab programme.&quot; Simpson-Daniel added: &quot;I&#x27;ve said to Nigel I want to be back playing and that means if everything goes well this week, I can target the Worcester game (on 29 January) for a return.&quot;</p>
