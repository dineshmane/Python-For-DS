			<p>The Football Association has said it will not be bringing charges over the tunnel incident prior to the Arsenal and Manchester United game.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Arsenal&#x27;s Patrick Vieira had earlier denied accusations that he threatened Gary Neville before the 4-2 defeat. Vieira also clashed with opposing skipper Roy Keane and referee Graham Poll had to separate them. &quot;The referee has confirmed that he is satisfied he dealt with the incident at the time,&quot; said an FA statement. It means United&#x27;s win will pass off without further intervention from the governing body, whose new chief executive Brian Barwick was in the Highbury stands.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t threaten anybody. They are big enough players to handle themselves,&quot; said Vieira. &quot;I had a talk with Roy Keane and that&#x27;s it. Gary Neville is a big lad, he can handle himself. &quot;They just played better than us and deserved to win.&quot; Neville admitted there had been incidents before the game, but insisted it had not distracted his focus. &quot;There were a couple of things that did happen before the game which disappoint you,&quot; he said. &quot;Especially from players of that calibre, but it&#x27;s a tough game and we&#x27;ve been around a long time.&quot; Neville admitted that he had not enjoyed the match, which was punctuated by fouls and the sending off of Mikael Silvestre for head-butting Freddie Ljungberg . &quot;I thought it was a horrible game in the first half, and it was not much better in the second,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no way that should have happened in a football match.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>After the match, Keane accused Vieira of starting the row. &quot;Patrick Vieira is 6ft 4in and having a go at Gary Neville. So I said, &#x27;have a go at me&#x27;,&quot; he said. &quot;If he wants to intimidate our players and thinks that Gary Neville is an easy target, I&#x27;m not having it.&quot; Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson added: &quot;Vieira was well wound up for it. &quot;I&#x27;ve heard different stories. Patrick Vieira has apparently threatened some of our players and things like that.&quot;</p>
