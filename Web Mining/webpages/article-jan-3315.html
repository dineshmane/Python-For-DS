			<span></span>
			<p>Liverpool legend Phil Thompson has pleaded with Steve Gerrard to reject any overtures from Chelsea.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The ex-Reds assistant boss also warned that any honours won at Chelsea would be cheapened by the bid to buy success. He told Online News Radio Five Live: &quot;Liverpool would think about any bid made but it will all be down to Steve in the end. &quot;But it wouldn&#x27;t have that same sweet feeling at Chelsea, where it&#x27;s all money-orientated and about simply buying the best.&quot; Thompson reacted sharply to some Liverpool supporters, who criticised Gerrard&#x27;s performance in the Carling Cup final against Chelsea. A number of fans questioned Gerrard&#x27;s commitment and sarcastically branded his own goal in Liverpool&#x27;s 3-2 defeat as his first goal for Chelsea.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Thompson added: &quot;I heard those comments from so-called supporters and they were diabolical, absolutely outrageous. &quot;Stevie carried the club last year and this year. He&#x27;s always put Liverpool first.&quot; Thompson, who savoured seven title-winning seasons and two European Cup triumphs during his Anfield playing career, is confident that the lure of Champions League football will keep Gerrard at Anfield. &quot;I hope Champions League football will beckon for Liverpool - either as winners or as finishing fourth in the Premiership - and he will commit himself. &quot;There has been a lot of soul-searching the way things have gone lately. &quot;I hope he&#x27;s hardening to the fact he will have big decisions to make but I hope it is to the benefit of Steven Gerrard and I hope it is worthwhile for Liverpool.&quot;</p>
