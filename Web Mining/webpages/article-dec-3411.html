					<b>Lewsey puzzle over disallowed try</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>England&#x27;s Josh Lewsey has claimed he was denied a late try in his side&#x27;s Six Nations loss to Ireland.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Wasps wing insisted he grounded the ball when he was bundled over the line and said referee Jonathan Kaplan had made a wrong decision. &quot;I&#x27;m positive I touched the ball down over the line,&quot; Lewsey told Online News Sport. &quot;It certainly wasn&#x27;t a turnover. &quot;I was driven over and I put the ball on the ground. The whistle went and I let go of the ball.&quot; Lewsey added: &quot;One of the Irish players scooped it back after the whistle and to our surprise the referee then gave a turnover. &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, that incident and Mark Cueto&#x27;s effort from Charlie Hodgson&#x27;s cross-field kick that led to what looked like a good try were the two key elements in the game.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Cueto was also puzzled as to why his try had been disallowed by Kaplan. &quot;I don&#x27;t think I could have been offside for, without a doubt, I was behind the ball,&quot; said the Sale player. &quot;The move was a planned technique, it was not off the cuff. We rehearse it time and time again. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say we were robbed, some decisions go with you and some go against you. Today they went against us and that&#x27;s tough at international level.&quot;</p>
