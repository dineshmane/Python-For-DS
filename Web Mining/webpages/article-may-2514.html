					<b>Smith aims to bring back respect</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Scotland manager Walter Smith says he wants to restore the national team&#x27;s respectability in world football.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Smith has joined his first squad for a three-day get-together near Manchester in preference to playing a friendly. While qualification for the 2006 World Cup appears to be beyond Scotland, Smith is anxious that the remainder of the campaign should be positive. &quot;I think we have got to try to get a bit of respectability back in whatever way we can,&quot; he said. &quot;We will have to approach each game differently. Obviously we will have to approach the Italian game away from home in a different manner to Moldova at home. &quot;We have to meet the challenge of each match.&quot; Smith, meeting a number of his squad for the first time, brought them together on Monday to outline his ideas for improving the nation&#x27;s fortunes.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>He said: &quot;I pointed out how I see the international team going forward and that was the main topic. &quot;This is a relaxed gathering and I don&#x27;t think there is a lot of doom and gloom about the squad that a lot of people think exists.&quot; A 25-man squad will spend the next three days based at the Mottram Hall hotel in Cheshire and will train at Manchester United&#x27;s nearby Carrington complex. Smith will be absent for the final sessions, however, as he is due to fly out to Sardinia on Wednesday to watch Italy&#x27;s friendly with Russia.</p>
