					<b>Continental &#x27;may run out of cash&#x27;</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Shares in Continental Airlines have tumbled after the firm warned it could run out of cash.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>In a filing to US regulators the airline warned of &quot;inadequate liquidity&quot; if it fails to reduce wage costs by $500m by the end of February. Continental also said that, if it did not make any cuts, it expects to lose &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars&quot; in 2005 in current market conditions. Failure to make cutbacks may also push it to reduce its fleet, the group said. Shares in the fifth biggest US carrier had fallen 6.87% on the news to $10.44 by 1830 GMT. &quot;Without the reduction in wage and benefit costs and a reasonable prospect of future profitability, we believe that our ability to raise additional money through financings would be uncertain,&quot; Continental said in its filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

			<p>Airlines have faced tough conditions in recent years, amid terrorism fears since the 11 September World Trade Centre attack in 2001. But despite passengers returning to the skies, record-high fuel costs and fare wars prompted by competition from low cost carriers have taken their toll. Houston-based Continental now has debt and pension payments of nearly $984m which it must pay off this year. The company has been working to streamline its operations - and has managed to save $1.1bn in costs without cutting jobs. Two weeks&#x27; ago the group also announced it would be able to shave a further $48m a year from its costs with changes to wage and benefits for most of its US-based management and clerical staff.</p>
