		<h2>Manufacturing recovery &#x27;slowing&#x27;</h2>
					<b>Manufacturing recovery &#x27;slowing&#x27;</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>UK manufacturing grew at its slowest pace in one-and-a-half years in January, according to a survey.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) said its purchasing manager index (PMI) fell to 51.8 from a revised 53.3 in December. But, despite missing forecasts of 53.7, the PMI number remained above 50 - indicating expansion in the sector. The CIPS said that the strong pound had dented exports while rising oil and metals prices had kept costs high.</p>

			<span></span>
			<p>The survey added that rising input prices and cooling demand had deterred factory managers from hiring new workers in an effort to cut costs. That triggered the second successive monthly fall in the CIPS employment index to 48.3 - its lowest level since June 2003. The survey is more upbeat than official figures - which suggest that manufacturing is in recession - but analysts said the survey did suggest that the manufacturing recovery was running out of steam. &quot;It appears that the UK is in a two-tier economy again,&quot; said Prebon Yamane economist Lena Komileva. &quot;You have weakness in manufacturing, which I think would concern policymakers at the Bank of England.&quot;</p>
