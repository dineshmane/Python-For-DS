		<h2>Wenger signs new deal</h2>
					<p>Wenger signs new deal</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has signed a new contract to stay at the club until May 2008.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Wenger has ended speculation about his future by agreeing a long-term contract that takes him beyond the opening of Arsenal&#x27;s new stadium in two years. He said: &quot;Signing a new contract just rubber-stamps my desire to take this club forward and fulfil my ambitions. &quot;I still have so much to achieve and my target is to drive this club on. These are exciting times for Arsenal.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The 55-year-old Frenchman told Arsenal&#x27;s website www.arsenal.com: &quot;My intention has always been clear. I love this club and am very happy here.&quot; Wenger has won the title and the FA Cup three times each during his reign. Chairman Peter Hill-Wood said: &quot;We are absolutely delighted that Arsene has signed an extension to his contract. &quot;Since his arrival in 1996, he has revolutionised the club both on and off the pitch. &quot;As well as the six major honours he&#x27;s won during his time here, Arsene has been a leading influence behind all the major initiatives at the club including the construction of our new training centre and also our new stadium.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The club has continued to reap the benefits of Arsene&#x27;s natural eye for unearthing footballing talent. &quot;We currently have a fantastic crop of young players coming through the ranks together with a number of world-class players who are playing a wonderful brand of football.&quot; Meanwhile, Arsenal director Danny Fiszman is looking for Wenger to stay beyond 2008. &quot;When we come towards the end of his contract we will both review the situation. I&#x27;m sure we will want him to stay on and I hope he will too,&quot; said Fiszman.</p>
