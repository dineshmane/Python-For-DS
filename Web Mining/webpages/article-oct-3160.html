					<b>WMC profits up amid bid criticism</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Australian mining firm WMC Resources has seen a fivefold rise in profits while continuing to be the target of a hostile takeover bid.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>WMC said it made net profits of 1.33bn Australian dollars ($1bn; Â£550m) in 2004, up from A$246bn the year before. It is currently arguing against an offer from Swiss Xstrata, which the firm raised to A$8.4bn last week after WMC said it was an undervaluation. Now reports say that the Australian government is against the deal.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Trade Minister Mark Vaile has said that the bid may be &quot;against the national interest&quot;. Mr Vaile, who was quoted in the Australian Financial Review, compared Xstrata&#x27;s attempt to take over WMC to a similar bid by oil giant Shell for Australia&#x27;s Woodside Petroleum in 2001. The bid was thrown out by Treasurer Peter Costello on national interest grounds. WMC&#x27;s interests in uranium deposits were a contributing factor, Mr Vaile said. WMC itself, however, has no objection in principle to being bought out, having spun off its aluminium operations in 2002 to make itself a more tempting target - as long as the price is right. Its stellar performance in 2004 has been built on sky-high prices for metals. Copper and nickel in particular have been in high demand thanks to China&#x27;s booming economy, which expanded more than 9% in each of the past two years. Nickel prices rose 43% during the year, with copper up 36%.</p>
