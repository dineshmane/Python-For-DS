					<b>Ferguson urges Henry punishment</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Sir Alex Ferguson has called on the Football Association to punish Arsenal&#x27;s Thierry Henry for an incident involving Gabriel Heinze.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Ferguson believes Henry deliberately caught Heinze on the head with his knee during United&#x27;s controversial win. The United boss said it was worse than Ruud van Nistelrooy&#x27;s foul on Ashley Cole for which he got a three-game ban. &quot;We shall present it to the FA and see what they do. The tackle on Heinze was terrible,&quot; he said. Clubs are permitted to ask the FA to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. The clash occurred moments before half-time when a Freddie Ljungberg challenge left Heinze on the ground on the left touchline. Henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the Argentine but his knee collided with the back of Heinze&#x27;s head.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The striker protested his innocence - and referee Mike Riley deemed the collision accidental. Ferguson was also upset by Arsenal&#x27;s overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side&#x27;s behaviour. &quot;Edu produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker,&quot; he said. &quot;There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. Phil Neville got booked for his first challenge. &quot;I am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. &quot;We have always been good at being gracious in defeat. What happened on Sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, don&#x27;t they?&quot;</p>
