			<p>Wipro, India&#x27;s third-biggest software firm, has reported a 60% rise in profit, topping market expectations.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Net income in the last quarter was 4.3bn rupees ($98m; Â£52m), against 2.7bn a year earlier. Profit had been forecast to be 4.1bn rupees. Wipro offers services such as call centres to foreign clients and has worked for more than half of the companies on the Fortune 500 list. Wipro said demand was strong, allowing it to increase the prices it charged.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;On the face of it, the results don&#x27;t look very exciting,&quot; said Apurva Shah, an analyst at ASK-Raymond James. &quot;But the guidance is positive and pricing going up is good news.&quot; Third-quarter sales rose 34% to 20.9bn rupees. One problem identified by Wipro was the high turnover of its staff. It said that 90% of employees at its business process outsourcing operations had had to be replaced. &quot;We have to get that under control,&quot; said vice-chairman Vivek Paul. Wipro is majority owned by India&#x27;s richest man Azim Premji.</p>
