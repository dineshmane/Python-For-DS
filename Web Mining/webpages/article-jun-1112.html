		<h2>Preview: Ireland v England (Sun)</h2>
					<p>Preview: <i>Ireland</i> v <i>England</i> (Sun)</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Lansdowne Road, Dublin</p>

			<p>Ireland are going for their first Grand Slam since 1948 after two opening wins, and <i>England</i> represent their sternest test of the Championship so far. <i>England</i> were sloppy and leaderless in the defeats against <i>Wales</i> and France and another loss would be unthinkable. The pressure is on coach Andy Robinson and his side have to deliver.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Despite England&#x27;s dramatic dip in form since the World Cup final - they have lost eight of their last 13 matches - <i>Ireland</i> coach Eddie O&#x27;Sullivan says his side should not underestimate the visitors. &quot;Had they kicked their points they would have beaten France and that would have created a different landscape for Sunday,&quot; he said. &quot;This is <i>England</i> we are talking about. They have a depth of talent and a very good record against Ireland. &quot;They will target a victory in Dublin as the turning point in their Six Nations.&quot; The differences between the sides is also highlighted in the team selections for the Dublin encounter.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ireland, despite having Gordon D&#x27;Arcy still out injured, have been boosted by the return of star skipper Brian O&#x27;Driscoll who missed the <i>Scotland</i> game with a hamstring injury. &quot;The knowledge that the <i>England</i> game was coming up really helped during rehabilitation,&quot; he said. &quot;The will to play in this game was enormous. It doesn&#x27;t get much bigger than <i>England</i> at home.&quot; As well as entering the tournament without players like Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall and Richard Hill, <i>England</i> have now lost two tighthead props in Julian White and Phil Vickery while blind-side flanker Lewis Moody is a major concern. Robinson, who received a lot of flak for the inclusion and then dropping of centre Mathew Tait, has kept faith with kicking fly-half Charlie Hodgson despite his horror show at Twickenham. If <i>England</i> slump in Dublin, it will be their worst run of results in the Championship since 1987.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But Robinson was bullish during the week about the game, saying that his side &quot;are going there to get in their faces&quot;, and has identified the line-out and tackle area as the key to England&#x27;s chances. And despite the recent results, skipper Jason Robinson believes there is nothing wrong with the mood in the camp. &quot;There is no lack of confidence in the team,&quot; said the Sale full-back. &quot;We have had a good week&#x27;s training and we are all looking forward to the challenge. &quot;I still believe in this team. I know if we get our game right we will win the games.&quot;</p>
