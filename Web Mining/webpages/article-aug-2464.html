			<p>Boss Sir Alex Ferguson was left ruing Manchester United&#x27;s failure to close the gap on Chelsea, Everton and Arsenal after his side&#x27;s 1-1 draw with Fulham.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Premiership leaders Chelsea and the Gunners endured a 2-2 stalemate on Sunday, giving United the chance to make up some ground in the league. But Ferguson said: &quot;I think what makes it so bad is that both our rivals dropped points at the weekend. &quot;It was a great opportunity - and we haven&#x27;t delivered.&quot; United went ahead through Alan Smith in the 33rd minute before Bouba Diop&#x27;s superb 25-yard strike cancelled out the visitors&#x27; lead in the 87th minute. Ferguson described the result as an &quot;absolute giveaway&quot; after United had earlier missed a host of opportunities to finish off the encounter. He said: &quot;It was a good performance - some of the football was fantastic - but we just didn&#x27;t finish them off. &quot;In fairness, it&#x27;s a fantastic strike from the Fulham player.&quot; The result leaves Ferguson&#x27;s side fourth in the league on 31 points - four points behind Arsenal and a further five back from Chelsea.</p>
