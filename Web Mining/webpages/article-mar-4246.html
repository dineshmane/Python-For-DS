					<p>Mourinho receives Robson warning</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Sir Bobby Robson has offered Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho some advice on coping under pressure.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The pair worked together at Barcelona and Porto and Robson had a word of warning for his protege. &quot;It has all gone for him just lately and that is marvellous, but sometimes you have to have a bit of humility and learn how to lose,&quot; said Robson. &quot;It is when it goes against you and you get a bit of bad luck that you learn, and he&#x27;ll get it straight.&quot; Robson was speaking after being formally granted the freedom of the city of Newcastle. &quot;Jose is doing very well at the moment,&quot; Robson added of the man who worked for him for six years. &quot;He has got one pot - possibly two to follow - a big game against Barcelona to come and I cannot see them losing their lead in the Premiership. &quot;They are in a good position and I would expect them to go on and win it, which is a wonderful achievement.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;What has occurred over the last couple of weeks will stand him in very good stead for the future. If he is intelligent, he will take it on board - and he is very intelligent. &quot;He will have learned more in the last fortnight than the last eight months. Before that, it was all about winning.&quot; Robson also admitted he would relish the chance to get back into management and test his skills against Mourinho. &quot;I am not in a hurry to take the wrong job, but I am ready to take the right job and I feel there is another job in me,&quot; he added. &quot;I know the area I am capable of working in and of course I would like a job in the Premiership if one was available. &quot;It would not worry me if I had to pit my wits against Jose. &quot;But it is not just a case of him and me against one another. It would be his team against my team - but I would not be afraid of that.&quot;</p>
