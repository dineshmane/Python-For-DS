					<p>Wales want rugby league training</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Wales could follow England&#x27;s lead by training with a rugby league club.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>England have already had a three-day session with Leeds Rhinos, and <i>Wales</i> are thought to be interested in a similar clinic with rivals St Helens. Saints coach Ian Millward has given his approval, but if it does happen it is unlikely to be this season. Saints have a week&#x27;s training in Portugal next week, while <i>Wales</i> will play <i>England</i> in the opening Six Nations match on 5 February. &quot;We have had an approach from Wales,&quot; confirmed a Saints spokesman. &quot;It&#x27;s in the very early stages but it is something we are giving serious consideration to.&quot; St Helens, who are proud of their Welsh connections, are obvious partners for the Welsh Rugby Union, despite a spat in 2001 over the collapse of Kieron Cunningham&#x27;s proposed Â£500,000 move to union side Swansea. A similar cross-code deal that took Iestyn Harris from Leeds to Cardiff in 2001 did go through, before the talented stand-off returned to the 13-man code with Bradford Bulls. Kel Coslett, who famously moved from <i>Wales</i> to league in the 1960s, is currently Saints&#x27; football manager, while Clive Griffiths - Wales&#x27; defensive coach - is a former St Helens player and is thought to be the man behind the latest initiative. Scott Gibbs, the former <i>Wales</i> and Lions centre, played for St Helens from 1994-96 and was in the Challenge Cup-winning team at Wembley in 1996.</p>
