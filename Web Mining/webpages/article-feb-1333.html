					<b>Fit-again Betsen in France squad</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>France have brought flanker Serge Betsen back into their squad to face England at Twickenham on Sunday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>But the player, who missed the victory over <i>Scotland</i> through injury, must attend a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday after being cited by Wasps. &quot;Serge has a good case so we are confident he will play,&quot; said France coach Bernard Laporte. The inexperienced Nicolas Mas, Jimmy Marlu and Jean-Philippe Grandclaude are also included in a 22-man squad. The trio have been called up after Pieter de Villiers, Ludovic Valbon and Aurelien Rougerie all picked up injuries in France&#x27;s 16-9 win on Saturday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Laporte said he was confident that Betsen would be cleared by the panel investigating his alleged trip that broke Wasps centre Stuart Abbott&#x27;s leg. &quot;If he was to be suspended, we would call up Imanol Harinordoquy or Thomas Lievremont,&quot; said Laporte, who has dropped Patrick Tabacco. &quot;We missed Serge badly against Scotland. He has now recovered from his thigh injury and played on Saturday with Biarritz.&quot; France&#x27;s regular back-row combination of Betsen, Harinordoquy and Olivier Magne were all missing from France&#x27;s side at the weekend because of injury. Laporte is expected to announce France&#x27;s starting line-up on Wednesday.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Forwards: Nicolas Mas, Sylvain Marconnet, Olivier Milloud, William Servat, Sebastien Bruno, Fabien Pelous, Jerome Thion, Gregory Lamboley, Serge Betsen, Julien Bonnaire, Sebastien Chabal, Yannick Nyanga. Backs: Dimitri Yachvili, Pierre Mignoni, Frederic Michalak, Yann Delaigue, Damien Traille, Brian Liebenberg, Jean-Philippe Grandclaude, Christophe Dominici, Jimmy Marlu, Pepito Elhorga.</p>
