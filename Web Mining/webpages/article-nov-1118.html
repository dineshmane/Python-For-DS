					<p>Mourinho defiant on Chelsea form</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has insisted that Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger would swap places with him.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mourinho&#x27;s side were knocked out of the FA Cup by Newcastle last Sunday before seeing Barcelona secure a 2-1 Champions League first-leg lead in the Nou Camp. But he denied his club was suffering a dip in form which league rivals Arsenal and Manchester United could exploit. &quot;They cannot speak to us about blips because they&#x27;re not in a better position than us,&quot; Mourinho said. &quot;Do they want to change positions with us? We are top of the league by nine points and in the Carling Cup final. &quot;The only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the FA Cup. &quot;In the Champions League all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still Chelsea.&quot;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mourinho said it was important to keep his team&#x27;s results in perspective. &quot;Don&#x27;t try to put pressure on me because I am never under pressure,&quot; he warned. &quot;We have lost one important game this week - at Newcastle - and we&#x27;re out of the FA Cup but I don&#x27;t think a defeat in a first-leg tie is a real defeat. We are just 2-1 down at half-time.&quot; Asked if his Chelsea honeymoon was now over, Mourinho replied: &quot;I have had 20 years of honeymoons with my wife. &quot;The day that this club is not happy with me is the day that I go.&quot;</p>
