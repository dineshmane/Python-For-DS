					<p>Farrell saga to drag on - Lindsay</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Wigan chairman Maurice Lindsay says he does not expect a quick solution to the on-going saga of captain Andy Farrell&#x27;s possible switch to rugby union.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Leicester and Saracens are leading the chase for the player, but Lindsay told the Online News it was not yet a done deal. &quot;As well as the Rugby Football Union, the league, the individual club and the <i>England</i> coaching team have a say, so it&#x27;s not a quick decision,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#x27;s given us 12 years service so if he wants to go, we&#x27;d support him.&quot; The prospect of Farrell switching codes has been the main talking point of the Super League season so far. &quot;It came as a bolt out of the blue to us,&quot; admitted Lindsay. &quot;But he&#x27;s a very loyal friend to the club, so there&#x27;s no question that he&#x27;s deserting us. He just fancies a challenge.&quot;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Although the move would be a lucrative one for both Farrell and Wigan, Lindsay said money was not a motivating factor for the club. &quot;The money side of things hasn&#x27;t been concluded, but it&#x27;s not the point for Wigan,&quot; he told Radio Five Live. &quot;A shortage of money has never been a problem for us. &quot;Even if we did have it, under the salary cap we can&#x27;t spend a penny of it anyway - we&#x27;d rather have the player.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Lindsay also said he understood why rugby union was so interested in signing up Farrell. &quot;It&#x27;d be a great loss for us but a great boost for them,&quot; said the Warriors chief. &quot;This guy is an absolute sporting icon. He&#x27;s been at the top for so long and has demonstrated so many attributes that you need to make it in a tough contact sport. &quot;Athletes like him - Ellery Hanley and Martin Johnson - don&#x27;t come along very often. You&#x27;re very lucky to have them whilst you&#x27;ve got them.&quot;</p>
