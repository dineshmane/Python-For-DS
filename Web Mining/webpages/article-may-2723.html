					<b>Claxton hunting first major medal</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>British hurdler Sarah Claxton is confident she can win her first major medal at next month&#x27;s European Indoor Championships in Madrid.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 25-year-old has already smashed the British record over 60m hurdles twice this season, setting a new mark of 7.96 seconds to win the AAAs title. &quot;I am quite confident,&quot; said Claxton. &quot;But I take each race as it comes. &quot;As long as I keep up my training but not do too much I think there is a chance of a medal.&quot; Claxton has won the national 60m hurdles title for the past three years but has struggled to translate her domestic success to the international stage. Now, the Scotland-born athlete owns the equal fifth-fastest time in the world this year. And at last week&#x27;s Birmingham Grand Prix, Claxton left European medal favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko trailing in sixth spot.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>For the first time, Claxton has only been preparing for a campaign over the hurdles - which could explain her leap in form. In previous seasons, the 25-year-old also contested the long jump but since moving from Colchester to London she has re-focused her attentions. Claxton will see if her new training regime pays dividends at the European Indoors which take place on 5-6 March.</p>
