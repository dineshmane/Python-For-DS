		<h2>Henson stakes early Lions claim</h2>
					<b>Henson stakes early Lions claim</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Six Nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four Home Unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to New Zealand with the Lions this summer.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting XV over the weekend was Gavin Henson. He&#x27;s very confident. You just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there&#x27;s an element of arrogance it&#x27;s good arrogance. He certainly showed some nice touches. He once showed a clean pair of heels to Mathew Tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand. And that&#x27;s without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty. But I think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test. He needs to come up against Brian O&#x27;Driscoll or a big French midfield. <i>Wales</i> fly-half Stephen Jones was another player who impressed me. He gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side. He showed he can control a game. With Jonny Wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and Jones, or maybe even Henson, could make the Lions team at fly-half.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than Charlie Hodgson after Saturday&#x27;s game. Some of the <i>Wales</i> forwards surprised me because I thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five. England prop Julian White is a capable player but when it comes down to selection Gethin Jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top. However, I still think White and Phil Vickery will be in the frame. Some English players did their cause no harm. I thought Joe Worsley had a solid game and Jason Robinson and Josh Lewsey both did nothing wrong. But it looked too soon for young Mathew Tait and I think it will be a while before we see him again. Despite being written off beforehand several Scots caught my eye against France.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Tom Smith has been there and done it before, but the likes of Chris Cusiter, Jason White and Ally Hogg all made their mark. Hogg made a couple of good runs while White had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there. Cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward. The star of Ireland&#x27;s win over Italy in Rome looks like a certainty to make the starting XV against New Zealand. Brian O&#x27;Driscoll is a class act. He ran some good lines against Italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although Italy defended man on man which made it easy for him. Gordon D&#x27;Arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but I think you could get a Henson, D&#x27;Arcy, O&#x27;Driscoll combination in the Lions midfield. Paul O&#x27;Connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and Malcolm O&#x27;Kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up, while Shane Byrne seems to be a lively character. But they will be a bit worried after the Italian pack drove them off their own ball on Sunday, although I used to play in Italy and I know how difficult it can be. One player who didn&#x27;t impress me was <i>Wales</i> scrum-half Dwayne Peel. He choked late on in the second half when <i>Wales</i> were trailing. They had good possession and he kicked the ball away - I wouldn&#x27;t want him as my Lions scrum-half after that.</p>
