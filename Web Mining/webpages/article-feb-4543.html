					<p>LSE &#x27;sets date for takeover deal&#x27;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is planning to announce a preferred takeover by the end of the month, newspaper reports claim.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Sunday Telegraph said the LSE&#x27;s plan was further evidence it wants to retain tight control over its destiny. Both Deutsche Boerse and rival Euronext held talks with the London market last week over a possible offer. A £1.3bn offer from Deutsche Boerse has already been rejected, while Euronext has said it will make an all cash bid. Speculation suggests that Paris-based Euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of £1.4bn, while its German rival may up its bid to the £1.5bn mark. Neither has yet tabled a formal bid, but the LSE is expected to hold further talks with the two parties later this week. However, the Sunday Telegraph report added that there are signs that Deutsche Boerse chief executive Werner Seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the LSE&#x27;s managed bid process.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Despite insisting he wants to agree a recommended deal with the LSE&#x27;s board, the newspaper suggested he may pull out of the process and put an offer directly to shareholders instead. The newspaper also claimed Mr Seifert was becoming &quot;increasingly frustrated&quot; with the pace of negotiations since Deutsche Boerse&#x27;s £1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-December, in particular the LSE&#x27;s decision to suspend talks over the Christmas period. Meanwhile, the German exchange&#x27;s offer has come under fire recently. Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful. Others claim it will weaken the city&#x27;s status as Europe&#x27;s financial centre, while German politicians are also said to be angry over the market operator&#x27;s promise to move its headquarters to London if a bid is successful. A further stumbling block is Deutsche Boerse&#x27;s control over its Clearstream unit, the clearing house that processes securities transactions. LSE shareholders fear it would create a monopoly situation, weakening the position of shareholders when negotiating lower transaction fees for share dealings. LSE and Euronext do not have control over their clearing and settlement operations, a situation which critics say is more transparent and competitive.</p>
