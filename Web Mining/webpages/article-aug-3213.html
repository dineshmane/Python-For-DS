		<h2>Poll explains free-kick decision</h2>
					<b>Poll explains free-kick decision</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Referee Graham Poll said he applied the laws of the game in allowing Arsenal striker Thierry Henry&#x27;s free-kick in Sunday&#x27;s 2-2 draw with Chelsea.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Keeper Petr Cech was organising his defensive wall when Henry&#x27;s quick free-kick flew in, which angered Chelsea. &quot;The whistle doesn&#x27;t need to be blown. I asked Henry &#x27;do you want a wall?&#x27;. He said &#x27;can I take it please?&#x27; He was very polite. I said &#x27;yes&#x27;,&quot; said Poll. &quot;I deal with the laws of the game. I deal with fact.&quot; Poll added: &quot;I gave the signal for him to take it. That&#x27;s what he did. &quot;The same thing happened when I refereed Chelsea against West Ham in an FA Cup replay two years ago - when Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored - and I don&#x27;t remember them complaining about that.&quot; Henry explained why he paused before striking the ball for the goal, which put Arsenal 2-1 ahead.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Henry told Online News Radio Five Live: &quot;The ref asked me if I wanted 10 yards or if I wanted to take it straight away and I said that I wanted to take it straight away. He said to me, &#x27;go&#x27;. &quot;It looks a bit strange because I took my time. I was waiting for Eidur Gudjohnsen to move and give me some space. &quot;At one point, he turned and that&#x27;s when I tried it.&quot; Former referees&#x27; chief Philip Don backed Poll&#x27;s decision to allow the strike. &quot;The advantage should go to the non-offending team. On this occasion it was Arsenal,&quot; Don told Online News Radio Five Live. &quot;Referees have been told to ask the player &#x27;do you want to take the quick free-kick?&#x27; or &#x27;do you want me to get the wall back 9.15 metres?&#x27; &quot;If they say &#x27;quick&#x27;, the referee tends to move away and allow the kick.&quot; Don was head of the referees for the Premier League and revealed all clubs were informed of free-kick options. &quot;We spoke to all the Premier League clubs as well as all the Football League clubs in the summer of 2003 explaining what the situation was,&quot; he added &quot;We gave them the option of either the quick free-kick or the &#x27;ceremonial&#x27; free-kick. Players and clubs were aware of what referees were doing.&quot;</p>
