					<p>Wales coach elated with win</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Mike Ruddock paid tribute to his <i>Wales</i> side after they came from 15-6 down to beat France 24-18 in the Six Nations.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;After going two tries down in 12 minutes we had to show character,&quot; said the national team coach. &quot;I didn&#x27;t have to tell them anything at half-time because those players have stared down the barrel of a gun before. &quot;They decided they didn&#x27;t want to do that again and came out fighting. It was a great team effort and we showed great character to come back.&quot; Man-of-the-match Stephen Jones, who kicked three penalties, a drop goal and conversion, was ecstatic following after the win at Stade de France.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;It&#x27;s just a special moment. Two years ago we didn&#x27;t win a single game in the Six Nations. But we&#x27;re a very happy camp now,&quot; he said. &quot;We worked hard as a squad and I&#x27;m a proud Welshman. We&#x27;ve got hard matches to come, so we&#x27;re just happy with the start.&quot; Double try scorer Martyn Williams was keen not to talk about a possible Grand Slam for Wales. &quot;We&#x27;ve got more self-belief these days. Two or three years ago we might have collapsed after going behind so early. &quot;There&#x27;s no mention of a Grand Slam among the players. We&#x27;ve got a tough game against <i>Scotland</i> at Murrayfield. They could bring us crashing down to earth.&quot;</p>
