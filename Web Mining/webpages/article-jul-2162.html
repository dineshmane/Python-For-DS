			<p>England coach Andy Robinson is facing disciplinary action after criticising referee Jonathan Kaplan in his side&#x27;s Six Nations defeat to Ireland.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Rugby Football Union (RFU) will investigate Robinson after deciding not to lodge a complaint against Kaplan. Robinson may even have to apologise for his comments in order to avoid sanction from the International Rugby Board. Robinson had said he was &quot;livid&quot; about Kaplan&#x27;s decisions on Saturday to disallow two England &quot;tries.&quot; The England coach went on to claim that &quot;only one side was refereed&quot;.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>After reviewing tapes of the match, the RFU decided not to formally complain to the IRB over the standard of Kaplan&#x27;s refereeing. Instead the RFU said in a statement they would, &quot;set out any concerns the England team management may have in a confidential manner&quot;.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>An IRB spokesman said on the matter: &quot;We take all breaches of the code very seriously. &quot;Should the RFU resolve the issue to our satisfaction, as happened last month when the <i>Scotland</i> coach Matt Williams apologised for remarks made, it would be the end of the matter.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Kaplan has vigorously defended his performance in England&#x27;s 19-13 defeat at Landsdowne Road and admitted he was &quot;very disappointed&quot; with Robinson&#x27;s remarks. And the South African has been appointed to take charge of Scotland&#x27;s match against <i>Wales</i> on 13 March.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The RFU recently fined Northampton coach Budge Pountney Â£2,000 and imposed a six-week ban for his criticism of referee Steve Lander after a Premiership match.</p>
