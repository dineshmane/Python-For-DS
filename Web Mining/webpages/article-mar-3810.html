		<h2>High fuel costs hit US airlines</h2>
					<b>High fuel costs hit US airlines</b><br><br>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Two of the largest airlines in the US - American and Southwest - have blamed record fuel prices for their disappointing quarterly results.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>American Airlines&#x27; parent AMR reported a loss of $387m (Â£206m) for the fourth quarter of 2004, against a $111m loss for the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines saw its fourth-quarter 2004 profits fall 15% to $56m, against $66m a year earlier. Both said high fuel bills would continue to pressure revenues in 2005. American, the world&#x27;s biggest airline by some measures, said it expected to report a loss for the first quarter of 2005. Southwest, which has the highest market value of any US carrier, said it would remain profitable despite high fuel prices.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>AMR&#x27;s shares were flat in Wednesday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as the results were slightly better than analysts had anticipated. AMR&#x27;s chief executive Gerard Arpey said the airline&#x27;s difficulties reflected the situation within the industry. &quot;AMR&#x27;s results for the fourth quarter of 2004 reflect the economic woes that plagued the airline industry throughout 2004 - in particular, high fuel prices and a tough revenue environment,&quot; he said. For the full year, AMR posted a loss of $761m, lower than 2003&#x27;s $1.2bn loss and an indication that the airline has successfully cut costs. AMR added that as part of its cost cutting measures, it is postponing the delivery of 54 Boeing jets. Shares in Southwest fell 65 cents to $14.35 as analysts voiced their disappointment. &quot;The results came in below our already conservative estimate for the quarter,&quot; said Ray Neidl, an analyst at Calyon Securities. Both American and Southwest have been squeezed by cut-throat competition in the US airline industry, as a glut of available seats has led to fierce price reductions.</p>
