		<h2>Llewellyn plans Wales retirement</h2>
					<p>Llewellyn plans <i>Wales</i> retirement</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Wales record cap holder Gareth Llewellyn will retire from Test rugby at the end of the Six Nations.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The veteran lock, who is 36 at the end of February, told Online News <i>Wales</i> Scrum V that it is time for him to bring down the curtain on his 92-cap <i>Wales</i> career. Llewellyn is on a one-season deal with French club side Narbonne, but said he may consider retiring from all rugby. &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do next year, whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career,&quot; Llewellyn said. &quot;Narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year, so I&#x27;ve got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else, but ultimitely coaching is where I&#x27;d like to end up. &quot;I&#x27;ve done all the coaching awards and everything you can do in that respect, so it&#x27;s just hopefully getting a chance somewhere.&quot; Fellow locks Robert Sidoli and Brent Cockbain, who both scored tries in Saturday&#x27;s Six Nations win in Italy, are <i>Wales</i> coach Mike Ruddock&#x27;s preferred starters in the second row.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>With the resurgence of the Dragons&#x27; Ian Gough and the adaptibility of lock-cum-flanker Jon Thomas on the bench, Llewellyn has not yet made a match-day squad this Six Nations campaign. But the former Neath and Ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt. &quot;If I do get on the field then brilliant, although the boys are doing really well and I&#x27;m very pleased for them,&quot; Llewellyn added. &quot;We&#x27;ve had some really tough years in <i>Wales</i> and the players have been through a hell of a lot. &quot;Sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away, but a few of us dug in there and it&#x27;s really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now. &quot;I was going to retire at the end of the last Six Nations, I&#x27;d even told some of the boys in the squad about it. &quot;But Mike (Ruddock) asked me to carry on for another season, which I&#x27;ve done, still part of the squad, still trying to help them out as much as I can.&quot; Llewellyn made his <i>Wales</i> debut in 1989 against New Zealand as a 20-year-old, having caught the selectors&#x27; eyes in the All Blacks&#x27; tour match against Neath. The 6ft 6in player has not looked back since, going on to break Neil Jenkins&#x27; <i>Wales</i> cap record on 12 June 2004 in the 50-44 loss in Argentina.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;There&#x27;s been lots of highs - winning the Six Nations in &#x27;94, beating <i>England</i> in &#x27;93, I&#x27;ve been on some great tours and seen some fantastic countries,&quot; Llewellyn said. &quot;But I think the best thing of all for me was the time I spent with the players, I&#x27;ve met some great guys in rugby and made some great friends. &quot;It&#x27;ll be a bit strange on international days having to find somewhere to watch <i>Wales</i> play, but at least I might have time to get my golf handicap down!&quot; Llewellyn captained Neath for seven seasons, while being an integral part of the Neath-Swansea Ospreys regional side&#x27;s first season. But with the Ospreys building for the future, Llewellyn was eventually forced to look to France for employment - digging in his heels during contract negotiations to insist he must be allowed to play for Wales.</p>
