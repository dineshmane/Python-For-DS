					<p>Strachan turns down Pompey</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Former Southampton manager Gordon Strachan has rejected the chance to become Portsmouth&#x27;s new boss.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>The Scot was Pompey chairman Milan Mandaric&#x27;s first choice to replace Harry Redknapp, who left Fratton Park for rivals Saints earlier in December. &quot;I think it&#x27;s a fantastic job for anybody apart from somebody who has just been the Southampton manager,&quot; Strachan told the Online News. Club director Terry Brady held initial talks with Strachan on Saturday. The former <i>Scotland</i> international added that joining Southampton&#x27;s local rivals would not be a wise move. &quot;It&#x27;s got everything going for it but I&#x27;ve got too many memories of the other side and I don&#x27;t want to sour those memories,&quot; he said. &quot;Everything&#x27;s right - it&#x27;s 10 minutes away, there are good players there, a good set-up, a good atmosphere at the ground. &quot;There&#x27;s lots to do but it&#x27;s not right for somebody who has just been the Southampton manager.&quot; Since Redknapp&#x27;s departure, executive director Velimir Zajec and coach Joe Jordan have overseen first-team affairs.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The duo had gone five matches unbeaten until Sunday&#x27;s 1-0 defeat at home to champions Arsenal, but the club are still in a respectable 12th place in the Premiership table. Strachan left St Mary&#x27;s in February, after earlier announcing his intention to take a break from the game at the end of the 2003-04 season. His previous managerial experience came at Coventry, whom he led for five years from 1996 to 2001.</p>
