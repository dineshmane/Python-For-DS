		<h2>Strong quarterly growth for Nike</h2>
					<b>Strong quarterly growth for Nike</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Nike has reported its best second-quarter earnings, helped by strong demand for its athletic shoes and Converse sneakers.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The global sports giant said it posted a profit of $261.9m (Â£135.6m), for the three months to 30 November, up from $179.1m in the same period last year. Revenues increased 11% to $3.1bn, from $2.8bn for the same period in 2003. Nike, whose products are endorsed by Tiger Woods among other sports stars, said &quot;demand continues to grow&quot;. The results came after a strong first quarter of the year for the firm based in Beaverton, Oregon.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Philip Knight, chairman and chief executive, said: &quot;Nike&#x27;s second-quarter revenues and earnings per share reached all-time high levels as a result of solid performance across our global portfolio. &quot;Our businesses in the United States and emerging markets such as China, Russia and Turkey, combined with favourable European exchange rates, helped drive much of this growth.&quot; He added: &quot;With the first half of our fiscal year in the books, we remain confident that our business strategy and consistent execution will allow us to deliver on our goals of healthy, profitable growth.&quot; The firm reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and gear, scheduled for delivery from December 2004 to April 2005, of $4.9bn. That is 9.1% higher than such orders reported for the same period last year.</p>
