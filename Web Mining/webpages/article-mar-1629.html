		<h2>House prices show slight increase</h2>
					<p>House prices show slight increase</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Prices of homes in the UK rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5% in February, says the Nationwide building society.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The figure means the annual rate of increase in the UK is down to 10.2%, the lowest rate since June 2001. The annual rate has halved since August last year, as interest rises have cooled the housing market. At the same time, the number of mortgage approvals fell in January to a near 10-year low, official Bank of <i>England</i> figures have shown.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Nationwide said that in January house prices went up by 0.4% on the month and by 12.6% on a year earlier. &quot;We are not seeing the market collapsing in the way some had feared,&quot; said Nationwide economist Alex Bannister. There have been a number of warnings that the UK housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004. In November, Barclays, which owns former building society the Woolwich, forecast an 8% fall in property prices in 2005, followed by further declines in 2006 and 2007. And last summer, economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between 10% and 15% by 2009.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The price of an average UK property now stands at £152,879. Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months, Mr Bannister said. He said if the growth continued at this level then the Bank of <i>England</i> may increase interest rates from their current 4.75%.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I think the key is what the Bank expects to happen to the housing market. We always thought we would see a small rise, they thought they would see a small decline.&quot; House prices have risen 0.9% this year, Nationwide said, and if this pace of increase persists, prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December. This is slightly above the 0-5% range Nationwide predicts.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Further evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from Bank of <i>England</i> lending figures released on Tuesday. New mortgage loans in January fell to 79,000 from 82,000 in December, the bank said. The past few months have seen approvals fall to levels last seen in 1995. The Bank revealed that 48,000 fewer mortgages were approved in January than for the same month in 2004. Overall, mortgage lending rose by £7.2bn in January, marginally up on the £7.1bn rise in December.</p>
