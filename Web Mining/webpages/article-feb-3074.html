					<p>Robben sidelined with broken foot</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Chelsea winger Arjen Robben has broken two metatarsal bones in his foot and will be out for at least six weeks.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Robben had an MRI scan on the injury, sustained during the Premiership win at Blackburn, on Monday. &quot;Six weeks is the average time to heal this injury and then I need a few more weeks to be completely fit again,&quot; he told Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. &quot;I had a feeling it was serious but because of the swelling it was impossible to make a final diagnosis.&quot; The 21-year-old missed the first three months of the season with a similar injury after a challenge with Roma&#x27;s Olivier Dacourt. And he added: &quot;It felt different then last summer when I had the same injury on my other foot. &quot;Then I could walk already after three days but I stayed sidelined for a long period. I hope that it will now take me six to eight weeks.&quot; Chelsea physio Mike Banks was hopeful that Robben could return at some point in March. &quot;The fractures are tiny and he could be playing next month,&quot; Banks told the club&#x27;s website. &quot;One is a chip on the side of his foot, the other is a small break on the third metatarsal. &quot;But this is not the traditional metatarsal that has become so famous since the last World Cup and which has kept Scott Parker out for two months.&quot;</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>David Beckham suffered a broken metatarsal in the build up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan. Robben, who has been a key part of the Blues&#x27; push for four trophies, claims he knew instantly something was wrong when he was felled by Blackburn midfielder Aaron Mokoena. &quot;I felt my leg go,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt it straight away after Mokoena hit me with a wild kick on my left foot.&quot;</p>
