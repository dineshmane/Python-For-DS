					<b>Hariri killing hits Beirut shares</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Shares in Solidere, the Lebanese company founded by assassinated former prime minister Rafik Hariri, fell 15% in renewed trading in Beirut.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The real estate firm, which dominates Lebanon&#x27;s stock exchange, ended the day down at $8.08. Traders said there was some panic selling during Friday&#x27;s session, the first since a three-day market closure to mourn the death of Mr Hariri. Beirut&#x27;s benchmark BLOM stock index closed down 7.9% at 642.80.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Solidere, in which Mr Hariri was a major shareholder, was the major drag on the index. The company owns much of the property in central Beirut, which it restored and redeveloped following the end of Lebanon&#x27;s bitter 15-year civil war. &quot;Solidere should be above $10 but because of this disaster it is falling,&quot; said one trader. &quot;If Solidere drops much lower I would consider it a buying opportunity. This is a very big company held by many Lebanese.&quot; Critics had accused Mr Hariri of using Lebanon&#x27;s post-war reconstruction drive for his personal financial gain. But his assassination on Monday sent shudders through Lebanon&#x27;s business community, which saw the billionaire tycoon as the country&#x27;s best hope for economic revival. Solidere posted profits of $12.5m in the first half of 2004, and its shares had been gaining in recent months.</p>
