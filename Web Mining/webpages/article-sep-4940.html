		<h2>UK interest rates held at 4.75%</h2>
					<p>UK interest rates held at 4.75%</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The Bank of <i>England</i> has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Rates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August. Recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. And retail sales disappointed over Christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers&#x27; optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. The BRC said Britain&#x27;s retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Today&#x27;s no change decision is correct,&quot; said David Frost, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC). &quot;But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. &quot;Dismal reports from the retail trade about Christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Mr Frost added: &quot;The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. &quot;It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.&quot; CBI chief economist Ian McCafferty said the economy had &quot;slowed in recent months in response to rate rises&quot; but that it was difficult to gauge from the Christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. &quot;The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,&quot; he said. &quot;Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>On Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. The ONS said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in November, matching a similar unrevised fall in October and confounding economists&#x27; expectations of a 0.3% rise. Manufacturers&#x27; organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. It also said there was evidence that manufacturers&#x27; confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;So far the evidence suggests that last year&#x27;s rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,&quot; said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. &quot;However, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the Bank should stand ready to cut rates.&quot; Some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the Bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.</p>
