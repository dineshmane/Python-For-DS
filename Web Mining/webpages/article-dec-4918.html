		<h2>Wenger dejected as Arsenal slump</h2>
					<p>Wenger dejected as Arsenal slump</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claimed their display in the 3-1 defeat against Bayern Munich was &quot;our worst peformance in the Champions League&quot;.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Kolo Toure&#x27;s late goal gives the Gunners hope for the second leg, but Wenger said: &quot;The only positive is that we are still in the tie. &quot;The players are really down in the dressing-room. I feel we really turned in a bad performance. &quot;At 3-0 we faced a real struggle, but 3-1 at least gives us a chance.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Goalscorer Toure was also at fault for two goals, and Wenger said: &quot;We need to help Toure rebuild his confidence as he is low at the moment.&quot; Wenger also tried to stay upbeat himself, adding: &quot;But there is enough time for crying. I could cry - maybe it would be easier - but life goes on. &quot;In this job, you have good and bad nights. This was a bad night - but I still have confidence in the quality of my players, as well as their spirit and desire.&quot; But Wenger&#x27;s Bayern counterpart Felix Magath was in no mood to celebrate either. He said: &quot;I am far from happy despite the win. My players failed to try and score a fourth to kill the tie and then conceded the late goal.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Arsenal are fully capable of scoring several goals against us on their own turf.&quot; Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, whose personal rivalry with Bayern goalkeeper Oliver Kahn was not helped by the result, said: &quot;Do I blame myself for the third goal? As a goalkeeper, I always blame myself. &quot;I just know the goals were very easy against us. In my time here, we have never conceded three easy goals like that - but sometimes it happens. &quot;It would have been impossible to go through at 3-0 - but with the goal we have chances. Everything is now possible.&quot;</p>
