					<b>South Africa sweep top awards</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>South Africa&#x27;s Schalk Burger was named player of the year as the Tri-Nations champions swept the top honours at the International Rugby Board&#x27;s awards.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The flanker topped a list which included Ireland star Gordon D&#x27;Arcy and Australian sensation Matt Giteau. Jake White claimed the coaching award while his side held off Grand Slam winners France to take the team award. <i>England</i> player Simon Amor beat team-mate Ben Gollings and Argentine Lucio Lopez Fleming to win the sevens award. Burger&#x27;s award came just a week after he won the equivalent prize from his fellow international players and White, who also coached Burger at under-21 level, paid tribute to him. &quot;Schalk&#x27;s emergence as a major force has meant a lot to South African rugby, but has also influenced world rugby,&quot; said White. &quot;He&#x27;s become to South African rugby what Jonty Rhodes was to South African cricket. It&#x27;s amazing what he has achieved in such a short time so far in his international career.&quot; Amor, who will captain <i>England</i> in this season&#x27;s opening IRB Sevens tournament, the Dubai Sevens, which start on Thursday, was delighted with his award. &quot;There are so many great sevens players on the circuit at the moment that this is a genuine honour,&quot; said the Gloucester fly-half.</p>
