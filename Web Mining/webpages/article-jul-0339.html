					<p>European losses hit GM&#x27;s profits</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>General Motors (GM) saw its net profits fall 37% in the last quarter of 2004, as it continued to be hit by losses at its European operations.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The US giant earned $630m (Â£481.5m) in the October-to-December period, down from $1bn in the fourth quarter of 2003. GM&#x27;s revenues rose 4.7% to $51.2bn from $48.8bn a year earlier. The fourth-quarter losses at General Motors Europe totalled $345m, up from $66m during the same period in 2003. GM&#x27;s main European brands are Opel and Vauxhall.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Excluding special items, GM&#x27;s global income from continuing operations totalled $569m during the quarter, down from $838m a year earlier. The results were in line with Wall Street expectations and shares in GM rose by about 1% in pre-market trade. For the whole of 2004, GM earned $3.7bn, down from $3.8bn in 2003, while its annual revenue rose 4.5% to $193bn. GM said its profits were also hit by higher healthcare costs in the US. &quot;GM reported solid overall results in 2004, despite challenging competitive conditions in many markets around the globe,&quot; GM chairman and chief executive Rick Wagoner said in a statement. The company recently announced that it expected profits in 2005 to be lower than in 2004.</p>
