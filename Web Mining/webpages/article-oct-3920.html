		<h2>Why technology in sport poses a threat to keeping the game fair, safe and affordable</h2>
					<p>Why technology in sport poses a threat to keeping the game fair, safe and affordable</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The history of technology in sport is a long and sordid love affair. It has thrilled, broken hearts, and either built success or elicited cries of fraud.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The humble golf ball is a good example. Fundamental to the game of golf is striking it from point “a” to “b” to end up in a hole in as few shots as possible. But apply a dimpled pattern to its surface and it can go further for less effort. Then optimise the pattern of the dimples and the ball will hook or slice less when struck. Suddenly the skill required to play the game is made easier.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Allowing any of these evolutionary steps is bound to trigger a debate about the importance and limits of technological progression.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Keeping it controversial</p>
			<p>History is littered with the controversial use of sports technology.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Polara golf ball is a case of an innovation making a sport too easy, effectively deskilling it. The innovation benefited lower-skilled players who had a greater tendency to make mistakes but not higher-skilled golfers who were already adept at making an accurate drive. It essentially deskilled the game – and was banned.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Full-body swimsuits captured the public’s imagination at the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. The introduction of the suit was shown to improve a swimmers’ performance dramatically as the designs evolved. After 43 records were broken in 40 events at the 2009 World Swimming Championships and 130 world records were broken in less than a year, the global swimming governing body voted to ban the full-length suits.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The tragedy was not that the suits were banned but that the world records remained in place. This meant that future athletes did not have the same advantage as those that had set them. This decision was arguably unfair.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Likewise the case of South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius. In 2008, he sought to compete in both the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The use of his prosthetic legs with carbon fibre blades resulted in a furious debate on what advantage they gave him.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>After a protracted dispute involving studies and counter studies, Pistorius was allowed to run in both – mainly due to lack of agreement on the issue.</p>
