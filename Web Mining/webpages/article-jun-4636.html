					<p>Petit career ended by knee injury</p>

			<span></span>
			<p>Former France midfielder Emmanuel Petit has ended his playing career after failing to recover from knee surgery.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 34-year-old ex-Arsenal and Chelsea star made the decision before Christmas after realising he would never regain full fitness. He told French newspaper L&#x27;Equipe: &quot;I knew straight away it was over. Twenty years of your life come to a stop. It&#x27;s like a small death.&quot; Petit had not played since being released by Chelsea last summer. A key member of the France side that won the 1998 World Cup, Petit scored the last goal in their 3-0 victory over Brazil in the final. He won the French League title with Monaco in 1997, and the Premiership and FA Cup double with Arsenal in 1998.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Arsene Wenger invited him back to train with the Gunners earlier this season, and at one stage considered giving him a contract. &quot;Globally I&#x27;m very proud of my career,&quot; Petit added. &quot;My only regret is having to put an end to my career because of an injury like Marco van Basten or Glenn Hoddle.&quot; Wenger said on Friday: &quot;I think it is a wise decision because he is in a situation where he couldn&#x27;t come back to a level where he was. &quot;I know Manu well enough - because I gave him his start when he was 18-years old - to know that he&#x27;s too proud to walk on the pitch and be the shadow of the player he was. &quot;Somebody asked me today whether I would be looking to bring in a player of his stature and I replied that you don&#x27;t find players of his quality available in January.&quot; Wenger, who brought Petit to <i>England</i> from his former club Monaco in 1997, added: &quot;He was fantastic. I feel his home is at Arsenal Football Club. &quot;We were lucky at Arsenal to have Petit at the peak of the career. He was a tremendous player.&quot;</p>
