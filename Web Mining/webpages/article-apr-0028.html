					<p>Robinson out of Six Nations</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>England captain Jason Robinson will miss the rest of the Six Nations because of injury.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Robinson, stand-in captain in the absence of Jonny Wilkinson, had been due to lead <i>England</i> in their final two games against Italy and Scotland. But the Sale full-back pulled out of the squad on Wednesday because of a torn ligament in his right thumb. The 30-year-old will undergo an operation on Friday but <i>England</i> have yet to name a replacement skipper.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Robinson said: &quot;This is very disappointing for me as this means I miss England&#x27;s last two games in the Six Nations at Twickenham and two games for my club, Sale Sharks. &quot;But I&#x27;m looking to be back playing very early in April.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Robinson picked up the injury in the 19-13 defeat to Ireland at Lansdowne Road on Saturday. And coach Andy Robinson said: &quot;I am hugely disappointed for Jason. &quot;As <i>England</i> captain he has been an immense figure during the autumn internationals and the Six Nations, leading by example at all times. I look forward to having him back in the <i>England</i> squad.&quot; The announcement is the latest setback for Robinson&#x27;s injury-depleted squad.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Among the key figures already missing are Jonny Wilkinson, Mike Tindall, Will Greenwood, Julian White and Phil Vickery - a list which leaves Robinson short on candidates for the now vacant captaincy role. Former <i>England</i> skipper Jeremy Guscott told Online News Radio Five Live his choice would be Matt Dawson, even though he is does not hold a regular starting place.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The obvious choice is Dawson&quot; said Guscott. &quot;Especially given that Harry Ellis did not have his best game at scrum-half on Saturday. &quot;Dawson has the credentials and the experience, even though his winning record at captain is not great. &quot;The other option in Martin Corry, who is the standout forward at the moment. &quot;Unfortunately <i>England</i> cannot rely on leaders on the field at the moment.&quot; <i>England</i> will announce their squad for the 12 March game against Italy on Saturday.</p>
