			<p>Women&#x27;s football legend Mia Hamm has played her final game.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Hamm, 32, who officially retired after this year&#x27;s Athens Olympics, took to the field for the last time to help the US claim a 5-0 win over Mexico. Hamm ends her career as the most prolific scorer - male or female - in international football, with 158 goals in 276 games for the US. She was twice Fifa women&#x27;s player of the year and won the World Cup in 1991 and 1999 and two Olympic golds. On her retirement, Hamm said: &quot;There are mixed emotions. There are things in your life that you have had to put on the back-burner and you can focus more time and energy on that now. &quot;I have to see what is out there and not commit to everything at the beginning.&quot; The friendly also saw the end of Julie Foudy and Joy Fawcett&#x27;s US careers. Hamm will now embark on a new life with husband, Chicago Cubs shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who was in the stands to watch her final game. He has just agreed a new deal with the Cubs after joining them in July.</p>
