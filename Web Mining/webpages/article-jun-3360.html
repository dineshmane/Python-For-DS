		<h2>US trade deficit widens sharply</h2>
					<b>US trade deficit widens sharply</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>The gap between US exports and imports has widened to more than $60bn (Â£31.7bn), an all-time record.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Figures from the Commerce Department for November showed exports down 2.3% to $95.6bn, while imports grew 1.3% to $155.8bn on rising consumer demand. Part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports. But the numbers suggested the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact, and could indicate slowing economic growth.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The trade deficit - far bigger than the $54bn widely expected on Wall Street - prompted a rapid response from the currency markets.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>By 1650 GMT, the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280, almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement. Against the pound, the dollar was down about 0.7% at $1,8923. &quot;The dollar&#x27;s fall has been sudden, violent and appropriate given this number,&quot; said Brian Taylor of Wells Fargo in Minneapolis. &quot;Recent exchange rate movements certainly haven&#x27;t had any impact yet.&quot; Treasury Secretary John Snow put a brave face on the news, saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion. &quot;The economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income... some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Although the White House officially still backs the US&#x27;s traditional &quot;strong dollar&quot; policy, it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued. The dollar has fallen by 50% against the euro - as well as by 30% against the yen - in the past three years. The main catalyst, most economists accept, is the large budget deficit on the one hand, and the current account deficit - the difference between the flow of money in and out of the US - on the other. The trade deficit is a large part of the latter. In November, the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals, as well as of cars, consumer goods and food. One small bright spot for US policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with China, often blamed for job losses and other economic woes. Although China&#x27;s overall trade surplus is expanding, according to Chinese government figures, the Commerce Department revealed the US&#x27;s deficit with China was $19.6bn in November, down from $19.7bn the month before. But the deficit with Japan was at its worst in more than four years.</p>
