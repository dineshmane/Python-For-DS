		<h2>Jones happy with Henson heroics</h2>
					<p>Jones happy with Henson heroics</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Wales fly-half Stephen Jones admitted he was happy to hand Gavin Henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against England.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when Wales, 9-8 down, were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in Cardiff. &quot;I knew the percentages of Gavin reaching it were far higher than me,&quot; Jones said. &quot;When he said he wanted it, there were no problems.&quot; Jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour, before Charlie Hodgson put <i>England</i> in front with 10 minutes left. &quot;I looked at where it was and I knew I was going to struggle to make it,&quot; Jones added. &quot;I said to Gareth (Thomas, the <i>Wales</i> captain) &#x27;This is touch and go.&#x27; It was out of my range and obviously Gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. He was confident and fancied it. &quot;There were no questions that he&#x27;d miss it the way he was playing. He had a superb game.&quot; Jones was happy to hail Henson&#x27;s heroic contribution to Wales&#x27; first win over <i>England</i> in Cardiff since 1993. &quot;Physically he&#x27;s a specimen: he&#x27;s a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he&#x27;s got a great kicking game as well,&quot; Jones said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;His defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game. &quot;I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s Welsh.&quot; Victory over <i>England</i> for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what <i>Wales</i> might achieve in this year&#x27;s Six Nations. But they now face three away fixtures in Italy, France and <i>Scotland</i> before completing their campaign against <i>Ireland</i> in Cardiff. &quot;People all over the world want to see <i>Wales</i> back at the top table of world rugby,&quot; said a proud coach Mike Ruddock. &quot;But we are not there yet. The next step is finding the consistency to get further wins. &quot;We have to travel this week and we can&#x27;t afford to get too giddy about this result. &quot;We have got to be professional and keep focused on facing Italy.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>None more so than Henson, who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of Jonny Wilkinson and Brian O&#x27;Driscoll. The confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however. &quot;I&#x27;m the sort of player who likes pressure on me,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes me more concentrated and I think I perform better under more pressure. &quot;I set a high standard against <i>England</i> and I&#x27;ve got to back it up next week. &quot;Two years ago when we played Italy I wasn&#x27;t involved and we lost, so we&#x27;ve got to put that right next week.&quot;</p>
