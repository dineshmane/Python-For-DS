					<b>China&#x27;s Shanda buys stake in Sina</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Chinese online game operator Shanda Interactive Entertainment has bought a 20% stake in Sina, the country&#x27;s biggest internet portal firm.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The move may be a precursor to a full takeover, with analysts saying that a better-known international firm may also now show an interest in Sina. Shanda said that it may boost its stake in Sina, even buying it outright. A merger would create a firm that offers online role-playing games, news, entertainment and wireless messaging.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Sina said that the purchase of a stake by Shanda would have no impact on its business.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The board of directors said in a statement that it would &quot;continue to act in the best interests of all the company stakeholders, including shareholders, employees and customers&quot;. Both companies are listed on the New York Stock Exchange&#x27;s (NYSE) technology-dominated Nasdaq index. In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Sina said its shares were purchased between 12 January and 10 February for about $230m. Rumours about a possible takeover boosted Sina&#x27;s shares by more than 10% on Friday. They added an extra 6.4% to $27.24 in electronic trading after the trading session had finished. And there may be more gains amid bid speculation when trading resumes in New York on Tuesday after Monday&#x27;s public holiday, analysts forecast. &quot;There could still be some potential parties that could still counter bid,&quot; said Wallace Cheung, an analyst at DBS Vickers. &quot;Even though Shanda has 20% of Sina, they still have quite a long way to take full control.&quot; However, Mr Cheung noted that a foreign company trying to take control of a Chinese internet portal firm, with its ability to filter and pass on news, may not be viewed very favourably by Beijing.</p>
