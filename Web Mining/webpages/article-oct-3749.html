		<h2>Steady job growth continues in US</h2>
					<p>Steady job growth continues in US</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world&#x27;s biggest economy.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>According to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004&#x27;s total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year&#x27;s main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;It was a respectable report,&quot; said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>&quot;Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.&quot; &quot;Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it&#x27;s showing job growth, it&#x27;s a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.&quot; That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.</p>
			<p></p>

			<p>Job creation was one of last year&#x27;s main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. &quot;Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case&quot; in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.</p>
