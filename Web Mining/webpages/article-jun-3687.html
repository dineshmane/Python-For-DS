			<p>Third seed Tim Henman slumped to a straight sets defeat in his rain-interrupted Dubai Open quarter-final against Ivan Ljubicic.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Croatian eighth seed booked his place in the last four with a 7-5 6-4 victory over the British number one. Henman had looked on course to level the match after going 2-0 up in the second set, but his progress was halted as the rain intervened again. Ljubicic hit back after the break to seal a fourth straight win over Henman. Earlier in the day, Spanish fifth seed Tommy Robredo secured his semi-final place when he beat Nicolas Kiefer of <i>Germany</i> 6-4 6-4. Afterwards, Henman was left cursing the weather and the umpire after seven breaks for rain during the match. &quot;It was incredibly frustrating,&quot; Henman said. &quot;It&#x27;s raining and the umpire doesn&#x27;t take control. &quot;He kept telling us to play till the end of the game. But if it&#x27;s raining, you come off - the score&#x27;s irrelevant. &quot;It couldn&#x27;t be more frustrating as I was very happy with my form until now. You don&#x27;t expect this in the desert.&quot;</p>
