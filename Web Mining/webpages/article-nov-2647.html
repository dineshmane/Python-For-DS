		<h2>Consumers &#x27;snub portable video&#x27;</h2>
					<b>Consumers &#x27;snub portable video&#x27;</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Consumers want music rather than movies while on the move, says a report.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Produced by Jupiter Research the analysis of the portable media player market found only 13% of Europeans want to watch video while out and about. By contrast, almost a third are interested in listening to music on a portable player such as an iPod. The firm said gadget makers should avoid hybrid devices and instead make sure music reproduction was as good as possible.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of Europe&#x27;s portable player market was likely to be music, rather than films or any combination of the two. Barely 5% of those questioned said they wanted a player that could play back both music and movies. Only 7% wanted a player that could handle games and video.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>&quot;Dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in Europe today despite their high prices,&quot; said Ian Fogg, Jupiter analyst. Mr Fogg said although video players and smartphones were trying to cash in on this success they faced a tough job because of the compromises that had to be made when creating a dual-purpose device. &quot;Europeans care most about music playback,&quot; he said. The report showed that 27% of consumers asked are interested in portable music players. The research revealed that French, 39%, and British, 31%, consumers were most interested in music players. Mr Fogg said portable video players were likely to remain a niche product that would not be able to compete with devices dedicated to music playback.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A separate report by Jupiter forecasts that the European digital music market will grow to 836m euros (£581m) by 2009. At the end of 2003, the market was worth 10.6m euros (£7.36m). Digital music players will be behind this market growth said Jupiter . Apple&#x27;s iPod was launched in October 2001, but the portable music player market has been growing steadily since the launch of the Creative Nomad Jukebox in mid-2000. Now consumers face an almost overwhelming choice of high-capacity portable music players that let them store every track on every CD that they own.</p>
