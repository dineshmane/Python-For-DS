		<h2>Moya clinches Cup for Spain</h2>
					<p>Moya clinches Cup for Spain</p>

			<p>Spain won the Davis Cup for the second time in their history when Carlos Moya beat the USA&#x27;s Andy Roddick in the fourth rubber in Seville.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Moya won 6-2 7-6 (7-1) 7-6 (7-5) to give the hosts an unassailable 3-1 lead with only one singles rubber remaining. Roddick battled hard and had chances in the second set, but Moya&#x27;s clay-court expertise proved the difference. Mardy Fish beat Tommy Robredo 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 in the final dead rubber to cut Spain&#x27;s winning margin to 3-2. Spain&#x27;s only other Davis Cup title came in 2000, when they beat Australia in Barcelona. This time they chose to play the final in Seville and the city&#x27;s Olympic Stadium was revamped to allow for a record crowd for a competitve tennis event of 27,000 spectators. And the home fans gave vociferous support to their players, with 18-year-old Nadal and Moya winning both Friday&#x27;s singles rubbers. American twins Mike and Bob Bryan gave the visitors hope with victory over Juan Carlos Ferrero and Tommy Robredo in Saturday&#x27;s doubles. But it remained an uphill task for a US team far happier on hard courts than clay, and 1998 French Open champion Moya had too much for world number two Roddick. &quot;This has been incredible - the moment I&#x27;ve been waiting for for years,&quot; said Moya, who missed out in 2000 through injury. &quot;I&#x27;ve prepared myself for this day. I knew that playing on clay I would have my chances to win.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The Davis Cup is my dream. I can&#x27;t ask for more. There is nothing bigger than what I&#x27;ve lived today.&quot; Moya stormed into a 4-0 lead on his way to taking the first set against Roddick and recovered immediately from dropping serve in the second. The match came down to two tie-breaks and Moya dominated both, clinching victory on his third match point. Wild celebrations followed, with an emotional Moya congratulated by his team-mates, including Nadal, who at 18 years and 187 days becomes the youngest ever victor in Davis Cup history. &quot;I think we put up a better fight here than in Paris two years ago,&quot; said Roddick, who was on the US team which lost to France in the 2002 semi-finals at Roland Garros. &quot;They were just better than us this weekend. I have nothing to be ashamed of, I gave it my all. &quot;I am not going to walk out of here with my head down, that&#x27;s for sure. &quot;There&#x27;s no miracle answer. We have to improve.&quot;</p>
