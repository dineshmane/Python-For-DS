					<p>High fuel prices hit BA&#x27;s profits</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>British Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Reporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of £75m ($141m) compared with £125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA&#x27;s chief executive, said the results were &quot;respectable&quot; in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. BA&#x27;s profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>In October, it increased this from £6 to £10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from £2.50 to £4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA&#x27;s estimated annual surcharge revenues - £160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra £250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. &quot;For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,&quot; BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>It also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA&#x27;s latest quarterly results as &quot;pretty modest&quot;. &quot;It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,&quot; he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. &quot;Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,&quot; Mr Eddington said. &quot;For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds.&quot; BA&#x27;s shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.</p>
