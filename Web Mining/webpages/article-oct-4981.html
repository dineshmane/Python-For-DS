					<b>Liverpool pledge to keep Gerrard</b><br><br>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry insists the club will never sell Steven Gerrard amid reports Chelsea will renew their bid to lure him from Anfield.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Gerrard reiterated his desire to win trophies with the Reds after his superb Champions League winner on Wednesday. And Parry has moved to scotch claims that Chelsea could launch a Â£35m bid. &quot;There is no chance of Stevie going in January,&quot; said Parry. &quot;That just won&#x27;t happen. Our intention is that we will never let him go.&quot; Gerrard scored a spectacular late goal to give Liverpool a 3-1 win over Olympiakos and book their place in the knockout stages. &quot;Of course he is ambitious but so are we,&quot; Parry added. &quot;We firmly believe that if we can satisfy his ambition he will remain a Liverpool player. &quot;We have an open and straightforward relationship. We both know where we stand and that played a big part in his decision to stay last summer. If he was not so committed to Liverpool he would have gone by now.&quot; Gerrard had said before Wednesday&#x27;s game he would consider leaving if the club was knocked out of Europe, with Real Madrid also believed to be monitoring his situation.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The main point I have made is I want to be in a Liverpool side which challenges for the Champions League and the title all the time,&quot; he said afterwards. &quot;I want to be winning things with Liverpool, not somewhere else. &quot;I am a fan as well and I think what I have said the supporters will agree with. &quot;We have to build on wins like that, not just settle for a great win and then not progress any further. &quot;My goal was one of the most important I have ever scored and I hope it turns out to be one of the most important for the club for a long time. &quot;I know I put a lot of pressure on myself because of what I said, and I felt I needed a big performance, but I am not going to go around telling lies about how I feel.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Reds manager Rafael Benitez believes Gerrard can win everything he wants to without moving clubs. &quot;Steven can win all he wants with us and we need him. He has seen that we have a good team and we can do more things in the future,&quot; said Benitez. &quot;But if we want to win more games, important games, we need Steven in the team. &quot;We need his strength, the strong mentality he has and his quality. I think he likes and wants the responsibility of leading this team.&quot;</p>
