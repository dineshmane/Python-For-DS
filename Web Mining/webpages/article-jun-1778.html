					<p>Barwick calls for Highbury calm</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>New Football Association chief Brian Barwick pleaded with Arsenal and Manchester United to show calm ahead of their Highbury showdown.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;When these two great teams meet it should represent all that is good about our domestic game,&quot; said Barwick, who started at the FA on Monday. &quot;It shouldn&#x27;t be the subject of recrimination and revenge for weeks and months following. &quot;That doesn&#x27;t set the right example for the rest of the game.&quot; Barwick also underlined his determination to clamp down on diving - or &quot;cheating&quot; as he unequivocally called it - in his bid to clean up the game.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>He said: &quot; &quot;There are always issues in the game and there always will be. &quot;One that concerns me personally is technically termed &#x27;simulation&#x27;, but let&#x27;s get real - this is diving. Cheating, in fact. &quot;We&#x27;ve all got to show more honesty here. Every week, referees are coming under intense scrutiny when making split-second judgement calls in this area. &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to get them all right and everyone has got to take a greater level of responsibility.&quot; Barwick is determined to get more respect for referees at all levels of the game. He said: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been impressed at the way in which the player-referee relationship in rugby union is based on mutual respect. &quot;I want to see this type of relationship at every level of football, from the Premier League to the Sunday League.&quot;</p>
