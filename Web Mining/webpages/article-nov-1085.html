			<p>PC first person shooter Half-Life 2 has won six Bafta Awards, including best game and best online game.</p>

The game also won Baftas for best action adventure, best PC game, art direction and animation. Burnout 3 won three awards in the categories for racing, technical direction and best PlayStation 2 game. Grant Dean, chairman of the Bafta games awards, said at a ceremony in London on Tuesday: &quot;The last year has been a great year for the interactive entertainment industry.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;These awards reflect the enormous achievements, progress and diversity that we have seen in that time.&quot; Halo 2 won the best Xbox game category, while Prince of Persia: Warrior Within was adjudged the best GameCube title. The sports award went to Konami&#x27;s Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Bafta said the &quot;significant feature&quot; of this year&#x27;s awards was the number of &quot;non-traditional games&quot;. The originality award was won by PlayStation 2 title Singstar while the children&#x27;s award went to GameCube bongo rhythm game Donkey Konga. The Handheld Award went to Colin McRae Rally 2005 while the mobile category was won by Blue Tooth Byplanes.
