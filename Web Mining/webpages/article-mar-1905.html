					<b>Chelsea ridiculed over complaint</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Barcelona assistant coach Henk Ten Cate has branded Chelsea&#x27;s expected complaint to Uefa as &quot;pathetic&quot;.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Blues are poised to complain about an alleged half-time incident during Wednesday&#x27;s 2-1 loss at the Nou Camp. The source of Chelsea&#x27;s anger was an alleged talk between Barca boss Frank Rijkaard and referee Anders Frisk, who later dismissed Didier Drogba. &quot;To react the way Chelsea have is pathetic. Mourinho lied with the line-ups, and now this,&quot; Ten Cate said. Uefa has said its own tunnel representative witnessed nothing unusual out of the ordinary during the half-time break. Spokesman William Gaillard said: &quot;Frisk says Rijkaard greeted him and apologised he had not had the opportunity to say hello before the game. &quot;We had two Uefa officials there and neither witnessed it. The referee&#x27;s dressing room was locked and he and his assistants were the only people allowed in.&quot; Indeed, it is the Londoners who could be on the receiving end of any punishment after failing to turn up for the compulsory press conference after the defeat.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Uefa delegate Thomas Giordano added: &quot;The only unusual thing that happened as far as we are concerned is that Chelsea failed to present themselves in the press conference.&quot; The referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to Uefa - weakening Chelsea&#x27;s case. Rijkaard was critical of Mourinho&#x27;s decision not to speak to the media after the match. &quot;There was a lot of talking before the game and now surprisingly there is a lot of talking after the game. It is not good behaviour after a match,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe they want to start something and make it worse than than it is. I really don&#x27;t understand it. I am very calm about it.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Barca midfielder Deco, formerly managed by Mourinho at Porto, agreed that it was not typical of his fellow Portuguese to lodge a protest. &quot;It&#x27;s not normal behaviour on his part. It was not logical he did not give a news conference,&quot; he said. Rijkaard added: &quot;Chelsea is the team which has conceded fewest goals in the English league and they defend very well so I am very pleased with the win. &quot;My men deserved victory and I am pleased to have won this match. I congratulate my players.&quot;</p>
