		<h2>Rovers reject third Ferguson bid</h2>
					<p>Rovers reject third Ferguson bid</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Blackburn have rejected a third bid from Rangers for <i>Scotland</i> captain Barry Ferguson, Online News Sport has learnt.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>It is thought Blackburn want £6m for the midfielder but chief executive John Williams has confirmed the club are still &quot;in dialogue&quot; with Rangers. The 26-year-old has already handed in a transfer request at Ewood Park as he seeks a return to Ibrox. But the clubs have been unable to reach agreement over a fee for Ferguson, who moved to Lancashire in 2003 for £6.5m. On Thursday Rangers said they would not be increasing their offer of £4m.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Blackburn have said all along that they want £6m for the midfielder and Williams has rejected proposals from Rangers over a player-swap deal. Williams said: &quot;We are in dialogue with Glasgow Rangers but we have no agreement.&quot; The negotiations will have to be concluded by midnight on Monday, when the winter transfer window shuts. Williams conceded any deal for Ferguson was looking &quot;unlikely&quot; before the close of the transfer window but Rangers still had a chance to seal the deal. &quot;We have no comment to make other than we have not got an agreement with Glasgow Rangers,&quot; he added. &quot;The way things are looking, I think it is unlikely we are going to. &quot;The ball is in their court but we have not got an offer that is acceptable at this moment.&quot; It is understood that Blackburn accepted a £5m offer for Ferguson from Everton at the weekend. But the player is determined to return to <i>Scotland</i> and rejected a move to Goodison Park. Ferguson did not play in the FA Cup win over Colchester on Saturday despite recovering from a groin injury with Rovers boss Mark Hughes claiming it had been an &quot;emotional and difficult time&quot; for the player.</p>
