					<p>Radcliffe eyes hard line on drugs</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Paula Radcliffe has called for all athletes found guilty on drugs charges to be treated as criminals.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The marathon world record holder believes more needs to be done to rid athletics of the &quot;suspicions and innuendoes&quot; which greet any fast time. &quot;Doping in sport is a criminal offence and should be treated as such,&quot; the 30-year-old told the Sunday Times. &quot;It not only cheats other athletes but also cheats promoters, sponsors and the general public.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Radcliffe&#x27;s comments come at a time when several American sports stars are under suspicion of steroid use. &quot;Being caught in possession of a performance-enhancing drugs should carry a penalty,&quot; she added.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The current system does not detect many of the substances being abused by athletes. &quot;This means that often athletes do not know if they are competing on a level playing field, if their hard work and sacrifice is being trumped by an easier scientific route. &quot;Often, when an athlete puts in a good performance, they are subjected to suspicions and innuendoes instead of praise. &quot;Having been on the receiving end of accusations like this I can testify as to how much this hurts.&quot;</p>
