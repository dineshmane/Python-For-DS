		<h2>Chelsea sack Mutu</h2>

			<p>Chelsea have sacked Adrian Mutu after he failed a drugs test.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 25-year-old tested positive for a banned substance - which he later denied was cocaine - in October. Chelsea have decided to write off a possible transfer fee for Mutu, a 15.8m signing from Parma last season, who may face a two-year suspension. A statement from Chelsea explaining the decision read:&quot;We want to make clear that Chelsea has a zero tolerance policy towards drugs.&quot; Mutu scored six goals in his first five games after arriving at Stamford Bridge but his form went into decline and he was frozen out by coach Jose Mourinho. Chelsea&#x27;s statement added: &quot;This applies to both performance-enhancing drugs or so-called &#x27;recreational&#x27; drugs. They have no place at our club or in sport. &quot;In coming to a decision on this case, Chelsea believed the club&#x27;s social responsibility to its fans, players, employees and other stakeholders in football regarding drugs was more important than the major financial considerations to the company. &quot;Any player who takes drugs breaches his contract with the club as well as Football Association rules. &quot;The club totally supports the FA in strong action on all drugs cases.&quot; Fifa&#x27;s disciplinary code stipulates that a first doping offence should be followed by a six-month ban. And the sport&#x27;s world governing body has re-iterated their stance over Mutu&#x27;s failed drugs test, maintaining it is a matter for the domestic sporting authorities. &quot;Fifa is not in a position to make any comment on the matter until the English FA have informed us of their disciplinary decision and the relevant information associated with it,&quot; said a Fifa spokesman. Chelsea&#x27;s move won backing from drug-testing expert Michelle Verroken. Verroken, a former director of drug-free sport for UK Sport, insists the Blues were right to sack Mutu and have enhanced their reputation by doing so. &quot;Chelsea are saying quite clearly to the rest of their players and their fans that this is a situation they are not prepared to tolerate. &quot;It was a very difficult decision for them and an expensive decision for them but the terms of his contract were breached and it was the only decision they could make. &quot;It is a very clear stance by Chelsea and it has given a strong boost to the reputation of the club.&quot; It emerged that Mutu had failed a drugs test on October 18 and, although it was initially reported that the banned substance in question was cocaine. The Romanian international later suggested it was a substance designed to enhance sexual performance. The Football Association has yet to act on Mutu&#x27;s failed drugs test and refuses to discuss his case.</p>
