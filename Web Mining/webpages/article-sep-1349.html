					<p>Davenport puts retirement on hold</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Lindsay Davenport has put any talk of retirement on hold after having a largely injury-free 2004 campaign.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The 28-year-old world number one had said that she would quit at the end of last year, but after a successful season she has had a change of heart. &quot;Finally I felt I put myself in a position to try and win Grand Slams again,&quot; said Davenport. &quot;It would be tough to walk away when I feel like I can contend so there&#x27;s no point in hanging it up quite yet.&quot; Davenport has won three Grand Slams, the 2000 Australian Open, Wimbledon in 1999 and the 1998 US Open. Her career has been hit by a series of injuries but last year she started hitting top form and won seven titles. She was due to take part in this week&#x27;s Hopman Cup in Perth but decided she wanted to rest her knee. &quot;I just really wanted to make sure my right knee was going to be able to really withstand all the rigours of the whole year coming up,&quot; she said.</p>
