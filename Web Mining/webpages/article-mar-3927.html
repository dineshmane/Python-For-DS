			<span></span>
			<p>A 20-year-old US man is selling advertising space on his forehead to the highest bidder on website eBay.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Andrew Fisher, from Omaha, Nebraska, said he would have a non-permanent logo or brand name tattooed on his head for 30 days. &quot;The way I see it I&#x27;m selling something I already own; after 30 days I get it back,&quot; he told the Online News Today programme. Mr Fisher has received 39 bids so far, with the largest bid currently at more than $322 (Â£171). &quot;The winner will be able to send me a tattoo or have me go to a tattoo parlour and get a temporary ink tattoo on my forehead and this will be something they choose, a company name or domain name, perhaps their logo,&quot; he told the Radio 4 programme.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>On the online auction, Mr Fisher describes himself as an &quot;average American Joe, give or take&quot;. His sales pitch adds: &quot;Take advantage of this radical advertising campaign and become a part of history.&quot; Mr Fisher said that while he would accept any brand name or logo, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t go around with a swastika or anything racial&quot;. He added: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t go around with 666, the mark of the beast. &quot;Other than that I wouldn&#x27;t promote anything socially unacceptable such as adult websites or stores.&quot; He said he would use the money to pay college - he is planning to study graphic design. The entrepreneur said his mother was initially surprised by his decision but following all the media attention she felt he was &quot;thinking outside the box&quot;.</p>
