					<b>Blatter suggests offside change</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Fifa president Sepp Blatter has recommended a radical change to football&#x27;s offside laws.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Blatter wants to simplify the current laws which partially rely on the interpretation of assistant referees. &quot;You must make the rule simpler by saying only the player who receives the ball can be offside - there should not be passive offsides anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;This means a player without the ball cannot be ruled offside. Purists will scream, but it&#x27;s a simpler rule.&quot; Blatter said he was not in favour of video technology overall, but admitted that Fifa was looking at the possibility of experimenting with goal-line technology to decide if the ball had crossed the line or not.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;One thing that is possible, and for which we&#x27;re looking for an acceptable solution, is the control of the goal-line to find out whether the ball was in or out,&quot; said Blatter. The 69-year-old also said he was keen to remain president of football&#x27;s world governing body until 2011. &quot;Let&#x27;s first complete the 2006 World Cup. And then, if I&#x27;m still in good health, I will still feel like continuing my work at Fifa because I was seriously hampered in my first term. &quot;The first half of my first term (between 1998 and 2002) doesn&#x27;t count. If national associations tell me to go on, why shouldn&#x27;t I stand once again?&quot;</p>
