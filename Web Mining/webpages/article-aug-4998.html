		<h2>Radcliffe will compete in London</h2>
					<b>Radcliffe will compete in London</b><br><br>
<font></font>			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Paula Radcliffe will compete in the Flora London Marathon this year after deciding her schedule for 2005.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 31-year-old won the race in 2002 on her marathon debut, defended her title 12 months later and will now seek a third title in the 17 April race. &quot;It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this for the 25th anniversary,&quot; said race director David Bedford. &quot;After announcing the greatest men&#x27;s field ever we now have the greatest women&#x27;s distance runner ever.&quot; Three years ago Radcliffe smashed the women&#x27;s world record in two hours 18 minutes 15 seconds.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Bedford star returned to London 12 months later, lowering her mixed-race world record of 2:17:18, which she set in Chicago in October 2003, by one minute 53 secs. Radcliffe&#x27;s career took a setback when she failed to complete the Olympic marathon and later dropped out of the Athens 10,000m last August. But the 31-year-old bounced back to win the New York Marathon in November. Radcliffe, however, passed up the chance to go for the &quot;Big City&quot; marathon grand slam. With wins in Chicago, London and New York, only the Boston Marathon remains to be conquered but that takes place a day after London. &quot;Boston is definitely a race I want to do at some point, but London is very special to me,&quot; said Radcliffe. &quot;I don&#x27;t pick races thinking about things like pressure. I pick the ones in my heart I really want to do. &quot;I love the atmosphere, crowds and course and know it will always be a great quality race. &quot;It is also the 25th anniversary this year which adds to the occasion.&quot;</p>
