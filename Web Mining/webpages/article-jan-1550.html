		<h2>Weak end-of-year sales hit Next</h2>
					<p>Weak end-of-year sales hit Next</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Next has said its annual profit will be £5m lower than previously expected because its end-of-year clearance sale has proved disappointing.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>&quot;Clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our expectations,&quot; the company said. The High Street retailer said it now expected to report annual profits of between £415m and £425m ($779m-798m). Next&#x27;s shares fell more than 3% following the release of the trading statement.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Next chief executive Simon Wolfson admitted that festive sales were &quot;below where we would expect a normal Christmas to be&quot;, but said sales should still top analyst expectations.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Among areas where Next could have done better, Mr Wolfson said menswear ranges were &quot;a little bit too similar to the previous year&quot;. Mr Wolfson also said that disappointing pre-Christmas sales were &quot;more to do with the fact that we went in with too much stock rather than (the fact that) demand wasn&#x27;t there for the stock&quot;. Next&#x27;s like-for-like store sales in the five months from 3 August to 24 December were up 2.9% on a year earlier. This figure is for existing Next stores, which were unaffected by new Next store openings. Like-for-like sales growth at the 49 Next stores directly affected by new store openings in their locality was 0.5%.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Overall sales across both its retail and mail order divisions were up 12.4%, Next said. Its Next Directory mail order division saw sales rise 13.4% during the five-month period. &quot;In terms of all the worries about their trading pre-Christmas, it&#x27;s a result,&quot; said Nick Bubb, an analyst at Evolution Securities. &quot;Profits of around £420m would be well within the comfort zone.&quot; However, one dealer, who asked not to be named, told Online News the seasonal sales performance was &quot;not what people had hoped for&quot;. &quot;Christmas has been tough for the whole sector, and this is one of the best retailers,&quot; he said. Next&#x27;s trading statement comes a day after House of Fraser and Woolworths disappointed investors with their figures.</p>
