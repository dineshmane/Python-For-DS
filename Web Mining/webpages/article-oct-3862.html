					<b>US firm pulls out of Iraq</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>A US company has pulled out of a major contract to rebuild Iraq&#x27;s transport system after attacks on reconstruction efforts, Pentagon officials have said.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Contrack International, of Arlington, Virginia, heads a coalition of firms working on a series of schemes. Its withdrawal from the $325m (Â£170m) contract in November is thought to be the largest cancellation to date. Contrack said &quot;the original scope of work that was envisioned could not be executed in a cost-effective manner&quot;. But the firm denied reports it was withdrawing completely from Iraq. &quot;Members of the joint venture including Contrack are committed to the ongoing reconstruction efforts, are actively working in Iraq and continue to look for new construction opportunities in the country,&quot; it said in a statement. The Pentagon&#x27;s Project and Contract Office (PCO) in Baghdad said it had taken over Contrack&#x27;s management of the subcontractors working on the transportation projects.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>US firms and their workers have been targets of attacks, and security concerns are said to be a major reason for the slow pace of reconstruction in Iraq. Of the $18.4bn in reconstruction funds approved by Congress, less than $2bn has been spent. Lt Col Eric Schnaible of the PCO told the Associated Press news agency Contrack&#x27;s withdrawal from the transportation contract was a &quot;mutually agreed-to separation&quot; and did not indicate a movement by US companies to leave Iraq. &quot;Some parts of the country are a whole lot more permissive than others,&quot; he added. &quot;Where we can get the work done, good things are happening.&quot;</p>
