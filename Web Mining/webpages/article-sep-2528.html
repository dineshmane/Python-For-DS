					<p>Venezuela identifies &#x27;idle&#x27; farms</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Venezuelan authorities have identified more than 500 farms, including 56 large estates, as idle as it continues with its controversial land reform policy.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Under a 2001 land law, the government can tax or seize unused farm sites. A further 40,000 farms are yet to be inspected, the state&#x27;s National Land Institute has told Associated Press. Vice president Jose Vicente Rangel has said farmers and ranchers with their titles in order and their lands productive have &quot;nothing to fear.&quot; Critics of the land reform policy claim president Hugo Chavez is trying to enforce a communist-style economic programme that ignores property rights and will damage the country. Land owners claim the National Land Institute has made mistakes in classifying lands as public or private.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>But the government - Venezuela&#x27;s largest land owner - say they are proceeding cautiously to prevent conflicts. In a statement, Mr Rangel said the land reform is not against the constitution, which permits private property, while stressing the efforts are to &quot;vindicate social and economically&quot; years of inequality in the country.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>One property in conflict with the government is the El Charcote cattle ranch, run by Agroflora, a subsidiary of the UK food group Vestey. Agriculture minister Arnoldo Marquez told Online News news agency the site&#x27;s documents &quot;do not guarantee that this is a private land&quot;. Administrators of the ranch, however, have complained that pro-Chavez squatters have taken over 80% of the property in the last four years, and the UK government has asked Venezuelan authorities to resolve the conflict. &quot;You should ask the company when they are going to put their papers in order and hand over the land that is not theirs,&quot; said Mr Marquez.</p>
