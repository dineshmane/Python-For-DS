		<h2>21st-Century Sports: How Digital Technology Is Changing the Face Of The Sporting Industry</h2>
					<b>21st-Century Sports: How Digital Technology Is Changing the Face Of The Sporting Industry</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>The sporting industry has come a long way since the ‘60s. It has carved out for itself a niche with its roots so deep that I cannot fathom the sports industry showing any sign of decline any time soon - or later.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The reason can be found in this seemingly subtle difference - other industries have customers; the sporting industry has fans. Vivek Ranadivé, leader of the ownership group of the NBA’s Sacramento Kings, explained it beautifully, “Fans will paint their face purple, fans will evangelize. ... Every other CEO in every business is dying to be in our position — they’re dying to have fans.“</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>While fan passion alone could almost certainly keep the industry going, leagues and sporting franchises have decided not to rest on their laurels. The last few years have seen the steady introduction of technology into the world of sports - amplifying fans’ appreciation of games, enhancing athletes’ public profiles and informing their training methods, even influencing how contests are waged.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Also, digital technology in particular has helped to create an alternative source of revenue, besides the games themselves - corporate sponsorship. They achieved this by capitalizing on the ardor of their customer base - sorry, fan base.</p>
