					<b>Worthington praises classy Villa</b><br><br>

			<p>Norwich boss Nigel Worthington said his side&#x27;s defeat to Aston Villa emphasised the gap in quality between the Premiership and the Championship.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;I thought the Villa performance today was very good. I think it comes down to the quality,&quot; he said. &quot;The jump from the first division into this level is a hefty leap. We&#x27;re learning all the time. &quot;Villa&#x27;s second goal summed it up. We are on the attack, then Robert Green&#x27;s picking it out at the other end.&quot; Worthington said he was happy with the performance of England Under-21 striker Dean Ashton on his Premiership debut after his Â£3m move from Crewe. &quot;It was very difficult for him but I thought he did exceptionally well,&quot; he said. &quot;He got hold of the ball and got shots in, which we&#x27;ve been shy on, so that&#x27;s a big plus. It&#x27;s his first Premiership game and he will find it a big step. &quot;We&#x27;ve got to give him time and be patient with him because I know, and he knows, there is a quality footballer in there. &quot;Once he gets attuned to the Premiership he will be one to watch.&quot;</p>
