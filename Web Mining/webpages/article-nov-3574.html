		<h2>UK young top Euro earnings league</h2>
					<p>UK young top Euro earnings league</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>British children enjoy the highest average annual income in Europe - more than double that of Spanish or Italian youngsters, a report suggests.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Children in the UK between the ages of 10 and 17 had an annual income of Â£775, said market analyst Datamonitor. They use &quot;pester power&quot; to get their parents to stump up nearly a third of this income, the report said. As for how they spend their cash, the bulk goes on personal care, soft drinks and food, Datamonitor said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Datamonitor adds that British teenagers are keen on personal care because it helps them combine two seemingly contradictory emotional needs - the desire to fit in and the desire to express their individuality.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>British teenage girls, compared to their counterparts in seven European countries, are the most keen to use make-up products. Nearly three out of four girls said they used make-up. According to the Datamonitor report the trend marked British teenagers out as &quot;particularly important to cosmetics manufacturers as they are likely to experiment more with brands and products and form long-term beauty routines&quot;. And the good times are likely to keep rolling for British children, as the report predicts that they will still be topping the earnings table in 2008.</p>
