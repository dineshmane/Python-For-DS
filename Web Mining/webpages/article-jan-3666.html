					<b>Benitez delight after crucial win</b><br><br>

			<p>Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez admitted victory against Deportivo La Coruna was vital in their tight Champions League group.</p>
			<span></span>

			<p>Jorge Andrade&#x27;s early own goal gave Liverpool a 1-0 win. And Benitez said: &quot;We started at a very high tempo and had many chances. It is a very important win for us and we could have scored more goals. &quot;We were very good defensively and also good on the counter attack. We are pleased but move on to the next game.&quot; Igor Biscan was outstanding in midfield after replacing injured Xabi Alonso, and Benitez said: &quot;He played very well. &quot;It is important to have all the players ready and a good squad so you can play more games at a high level.&quot; Benitez added: &quot;It is all back in our own hands now, it was a great win for us and I was delighted with what I feel was the best Liverpool I have seen. &quot;As far as my feelings about winning in Spain, that is really not important. &quot;I want to see us win away matches in the Champions League, that it was in Spain was not my first consideration. &quot;As far as I am concerned it is important for Liverpool to win, it is not important in what country it is in.&quot; Benitez added: Benitez said: &quot;We had a problem before the start, it was decided that Xabi could not play more than 45 minutes. &quot;But in the end because of the way that (Dietmar) Hamann and (Igor) Biscan performed, we did not need to change things until right at the end of the match. &quot;Depor are a good team and if you allow them to keep possession they can be very dangerous indeed. &quot;But we knew that if we hit them on the counter-attack it would make them nervous, and that is how it worked out.&quot; Deportivo coach Javier Irureta said: &quot;Liverpool played very well and we just could not break them down. &quot;I know we have now gone six games at home in Europe without scoring, but that does not reflect our overall performances. &quot;But this time we did not play well and we lacked imagination. &quot;The goal was a bad mistake and a big blow to our confidence. Players who usually want the ball at that stage did not want it. &quot;I know we are bottom of the group, but as long as there is hope of qualifying, we will hang on to that.&quot;</p>
