					<b>Roddick into San Jose final</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Andy Roddick will play Cyril Saulnier in the final of the SAP Open in San Jose on Sunday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The American top seed and defending champion overcame Germany&#x27;s Tommy Haas, the third seed, 7-6 (7-3) 6-3. And Saulnier survived an injury scare in his semi-final with seventh-seeded Austrian Jurgen Melzer. The Frenchman twisted his ankle early in the second set but overcame Melzer, who was left fuming over a series of line calls, 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3. &quot;I was feeling horrible earlier in the week,&quot; Roddick said. &quot;I thought tonight was another step in the right direction. &quot;On my returns, I was standing in more and I&#x27;m getting a little more depth, even if I don&#x27;t hit a perfect return.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Roddick won the last four points of the first-set tie-break before being broken at the start of the second set. But he broke straight back and then broke Haas again to lead 4-2. &quot;It&#x27;s extremely frustrating when you have chances against a top-five player and don&#x27;t do anything with them,&quot; admitted Haas. &quot;I rushed a few backhands and he took advantage.&quot; Saulnier will move into the world&#x27;s top 50 for the first time after his passage through to the final. &quot;It&#x27;s taken a lot of work and a lot of fighting in my mind,&quot; he revealed. &quot;Sometimes I didn&#x27;t believe I could get to a final and now I am here. I&#x27;ve stayed mentally strong. &quot;I&#x27;m on the way. I&#x27;ll keep fighting and work a lot and I&#x27;ll be up there.&quot;</p>
