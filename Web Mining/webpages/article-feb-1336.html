					<b>Republic to face China and Italy</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Republic of <i>Ireland</i> have arranged friendlies against China and Italy which will take place at Lansdowne Road in March and August.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Brian Kerr&#x27;s side will face the 54th ranked Chinese on 29 March - just three days after the World Cup qualifier against Israel in Tel Aviv. Italy will visit on 17 August in what will be a warm-up game ahead of the autumn World Cup qualifiers. In their last meeting, the Irish beat Italy in the 1994 World Cup Finals. However, that is the Republic&#x27;s only victory in eight attempts against the Italians who have won all the other seven games. The 29 March game will be the second time the Republic have played China - the previous encounter back in June 1984 with the Irish winning 1-0 in Sapporo, Japan. Brian Kerr said: &quot;China have made great progress over the last few years and will provide difficult opposition. &quot;We all witnessed the performances of the Asian teams in the last World Cup, and China play a similar type of football. &quot;As for Italy, they make a welcome return to Dublin and will be a massive attraction because they are one of the great traditional powers in the world. &quot;The game will be ideal preparation for the three important World Cup qualifiers in the autumn.&quot; <i>Ireland</i> round off their World Cup campaign with games against France on 7 September, Cyprus on 8 October and Switzerland on 12 October.</p>
