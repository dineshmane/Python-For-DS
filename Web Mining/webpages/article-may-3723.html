					<b>Ferguson hails Man Utd&#x27;s resolve</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Manchester United&#x27;s Alex Ferguson has praised his players&#x27; gutsy performance in the 1-0 win at Aston Villa.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;That was our hardest away game of the season and it was a fantastic game of football, end-to-end with lots of good passing,&quot; said the Old Trafford boss. &quot;We showed lots of character and guts and we weren&#x27;t going to lose. &quot;I look at that fixture and think we&#x27;ve been there and won, while Arsenal and Chelsea have yet to come and Villa may have some players back when they do.&quot; Ferguson also hailed senior stars Ryan Giggs and Roy Keane, who came off the bench for the injured John O&#x27;Shea. &quot;Roy came on and brought a bit of composure to the midfield which we needed and which no other player has got. &quot;Giggs was a tremendous threat and he brings tremendous penetration. &quot;All we can do is maintain our form, play as we are and we&#x27;ll get our rewards.&quot;</p>
