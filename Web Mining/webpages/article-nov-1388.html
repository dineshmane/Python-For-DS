		<h2>Wales hails new superstar</h2>
					<b>Wales hails new superstar</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>One game into his Six Nations career, and Gavin Henson is already a Welsh legend.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>A mesmeric display against England, topped off by his howitzer of a match-winning penalty, has secured life membership of that particular club. At 23, Henson has the rugby world at his silver-booted feet. And if his natural self-assurance and swagger is shared by his <i>Wales</i> team-mates, then a full-blown revival could be more than just a lot of hot air drifting up from the Valleys. The &quot;Red Dragonhood&quot; subdued the &quot;Red Rose Army&quot; in most areas of the field, but Henson&#x27;s stellar performance ensured their efforts yielded the win they craved above all others. He announced himself in the game&#x27;s opening salvo with a &quot;Welcome to Cardiff&quot; greeting for Mark Cueto on the gain line. And his defence was a major feature of the match, his principal victim poor old, or rather young, Mathew Tait. The <i>England</i> centre will have spent his 19th birthday on Sunday shuddering at the memory of how he was up-ended not just once, but twice, by Henson&#x27;s all-enveloping tackles.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The second time, after the interval, single-handedly lifted the record Millennium Stadium crowd at a time when <i>England</i> were starting to show menace. Showing awesome strength, Henson nonchantly held the bewildered debutant in mid-air, a master predator toying with his helpless prey, savouring the kill. His kicking game also prospered, particularly when he moved to full-back for 10 minutes either side of half-time when his captain Gareth Thomas was in the sin-bin. One huge clearance from Tait&#x27;s kick sent <i>England</i> retreating rapidly while another booming punt to the right corner kept the visitors pinned in their own half. Henson was also creativity personified: one little chip ahead for Shane Williams narrowly missed its target; a precise cross-kick forcing Jamie Noon to fumble the ball into touch. He also had a hand in the game&#x27;s only try, finished superbly by Williams, and might have scored himself on the half-hour as he glided into space, only to be scragged by Tait. Henson was twice repelled as <i>Wales</i> laid siege to the English line after Charlie Hodgson&#x27;s penalty had edged the visitors in front for the first time. But he was not to be denied as the crescendo rose to a deafening din, and the outcome of the match fell to him. Replacement Gareth Cooper made the most of a poor Welsh scrum by chipping into space, where Jason Robinson was penalised for holding on in the tackle.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Five metres in from the right touchline, 44 metres out, it was not a kick Stephen Jones, who had seen a long-range effort fall agonisingly under the bar, would have approached with confidence. &quot;It was out of Steve&#x27;s range but I looked at Gavin, and he gave me a reassuring nod,&quot; said Thomas. Henson, surveying his date with destiny, positively relished the responsibility, and the chance to make himself a hero. Without further ado, he nervelessly slotted the kick that ended five years of English dominance and 12 years of waiting in Cardiff. &quot;I knew I was going to get it before I even took the kick,&quot; he said later, his distinct spikey locks freshly gelled into an appropriate star shape. &quot;I have been getting them from that distance all year so it wasn&#x27;t a problem.&quot; There were still four minutes for <i>Wales</i> to hold out, and the frenzy was such that Henson could not even hear Jones shouting instructions at him from three yards away. But it was <i>Wales</i> who finished the game on the attack, almost snatching a second try in a thunderous climax. &quot;Just Do It&quot; implored the front page headline on Saturday&#x27;s Western Mail newspaper. And, thanks to Henson, <i>Wales</i> did.</p>
