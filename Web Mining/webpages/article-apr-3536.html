					<b>Hodges announces rugby retirement</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Scarlets and USA Eagles forward Dave Hodges has ended his playing career to pursue a coaching role in the States.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>The 36-year-old, who has 54 caps, was Llanelli&#x27;s player of the season in 2001/2, but has battled injury for the last two of his seven years at Stradey. He tore a pectoral muscle against the Ospreys on Boxing Day, an injury that would have kept him out for the season. &quot;Realising I would be unable to play this season, the club and I agreed to end my contract early,&quot; said Hodges.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;It allows me to move back to the US and pursue opportunities there and allows the Scarlets to look to the next generation.&quot; The Scarlets have begun to rebuild their squad for next season after a disappointing Heineken Cup campaign, with plenty more signings and departures expected in the coming weeks.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Scarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher confirmed that 17 of the current squad would be out of contract in the summer. &quot;We have a deliberate policy whereby around half the squad are coming out of contract and they know they won&#x27;t all be re-signed, it&#x27;s a chance to invigorate the squad,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m positive about the future of the Scarlets both on and off the field.&quot; Gallacher was keen to pay tribute to the role back-five forward Hodges has played at Stradey Park, though. &quot;David has been a highly influential member of our squad for seven years,&quot; said Gallacher. &quot;He is a real professional and we thank him for the part he has played in our success. &quot;I am sure he has an enormous contribution to make to the development of rugby in the US and we wish him and his family well.&quot; Hodges described his years at Stradey as &quot;the best time of my life.&quot;</p>
