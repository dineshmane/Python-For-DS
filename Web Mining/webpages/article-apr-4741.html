					<p>Collins banned in landmark case</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Sprinter Michelle Collins has received an eight-year ban for doping offences after a hearing at the North American Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>America&#x27;s former world indoor 200m champion is the first athlete to be suspended without a positive drugs test or an admission of drugs use. Collins&#x27; ban is a result of her connection to the federal inquiry into the Balco doping scandal. The 33-year-old was found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs. The US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) decided to press charges against Collins in the summer. The sprinter has consistently protested her innocence but the CAS has upheld USADA&#x27;s findings. &quot;The USADA has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Collins took EPO, the testosterone/epitestosterone cream and THG,&quot; said a CAS statement. &quot;Collins used these substances to enhance her performance and elude the drug testing that was available at the time.&quot; So far a total of 13 athletes have been sanctioned for violations involving drugs associated with the Balco doping scandal. World record holder Tim Montgomery is also facing a lifetime ban after being charged by the USADA. His hearing before the CSA has been rescheduled for June next year.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Drug enforcement chiefs in the US have vowed to crack down on cheats. USADA chief executive officer Terry Madden said the action taken against Collins was further proof of that. &quot;The CAS panel&#x27;s decision confirms that those who violate the rules will be sanctioned as part of USADA&#x27;s ongoing efforts to protect the rights of the overwhelming majority of US athletes that compete drug-free,&quot; said Madden. The USADA has built its cases on verbal evidence given to the federal investigation into Balco rather than test results. The San Francisco-based Balco laboratory faces steroid distribution and money laundering charges. The trial is expected to open next March.</p>
