		<h2>Safin relieved at Aussie recovery</h2>
					<p>Safin relieved at Aussie recovery</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Marat Safin admitted he thought he was suffering another Australian Open final nightmare when he lost the opening set to Lleyton Hewitt.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Russian, who lost the 2002 and 2004 finals, fought back brilliantly to win 1-6 6-3 6-4 6-4. &quot;I was nervous and I couldn&#x27;t play tennis,&quot; said Safin. &quot;He started really well. He wasn&#x27;t as nervous as I was because I was thinking of the two finals that I played and wasn&#x27;t successful.&quot; He added: &quot;You really have to deal with the pressure because normally it never happens but when you come to the final you are so tight because you want to win. &quot;I tried to play some tennis but I couldn&#x27;t. He has huge experience, he&#x27;s won two Grand Slam titles, he&#x27;s won 24 titles, he&#x27;s a great player and he deals with pressure.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>From 4-1 down in the third set, Safin played some of his best tennis to reel off seven games and take control of the match. &quot;In the third set, just all of a sudden, it all turn around completely in a way I couldn&#x27;t expect,&quot; said Safin. &quot;Because he made a couple of mistakes, I was a little bit lucky at some point, then the confidence came back and I was back in the game.&quot; And the Russian revealed that the victory, and his semi-final win over world number one Roger Federer, had given him a massive boost for the future. &quot;You get huge confidence because Roger is a great player,&quot; said Safin. &quot;Once I beat him, and then Lleyton, it&#x27;s like you get so much confidence in yourself that you really can play great. &quot;You can win big titles and you can beat huge players in the finals and semi-finals.&quot;</p>
