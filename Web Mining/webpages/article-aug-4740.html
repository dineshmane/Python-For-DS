					<b>Santini resigns as Spurs manager</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Tottenham manager Jacques Santini has resigned for &quot;personal reasons&quot;.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The former France manager moved to White Hart Lane this summer but now wants to return to France. Santini said: &quot;My time at Tottenham has been memorable and it is with deep regret that I take my leave. I wish the club and the supporters all the best. &quot;Private issues in my personal life have arisen which caused my decision. I very much hope that the wonderful fans will respect my decision.&quot; He added: &quot;I should like to thank (sporting director) Frank Arnesen and (chairman) Daniel Levy for their understanding.&quot; Assistant coach Martin Jol has been put in temporary charge and will take care of team affairs for Saturday&#x27;s Premiership match against Charlton.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Arnesen said the club were sad to see Santini go: &quot;We are obviously disappointed that Jacques is leaving us. We fully respect his decision. &quot;I can assure you that the club will act swiftly to minimise the impact of Jacques&#x27; departure. &quot;Our priority is to ensure that this season&#x27;s performance remains unaffected by this move. &quot;I shall make a further statement on Monday, clarifying our position. We wish Jacques well.&quot;</p>
