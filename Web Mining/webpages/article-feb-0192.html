					<p>Chinese billionaire targets Manchester United shares in new deal, reports suggest</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>A MYSTERY Chinese investor is thought to be interested in purchasing a stake in Manchester United, according to reports. A group is working on behalf of an unnamed billionaire Asian buyer to judge the potential interest of various independent shareholders in selling up, according to reports.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>The club is listed on the New York stock exchange and the negotiators want to secure something in the region of an eight per cent stake.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>There have been persistent rumours that some members of the Glazer family – who control some 80 per cent of the club – are ready to relinquish a large chunk of shares. The six children of the late Malcolm Glazer, who purchased the club for £790million in 2005, reportedly hold differing views on whether to sell their shares. The takeover was controversial because the Florida based businessman had to borrow £525million, which the club was then burdened with. Since then, they have spent an estimated £1billion servicing that debt.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>In June, Manchester United was hailed as the world’s most valuable football club by Forbes magazine.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Football clubs continue to be attractive trophy assets for billionaires around the world with Chinese buyers recently acquiring a host of English clubs.</p>
