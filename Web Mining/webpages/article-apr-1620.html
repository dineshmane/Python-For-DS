					<p>O&#x27;Connell rejects Lions rumours</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ireland and Munster lock Paul O&#x27;Connell has dismissed media reports linking him to the captaincy of the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>O&#x27;Connell is rumoured to be among the front-runners for the job, but says he is totally focused on Sunday&#x27;s Six Nations crunch clash with England. &quot;I honestly don&#x27;t think about these reports,&quot; he told Online News Sport. &quot;The Lions thing is all speculation and newspaper talk, nothing more. I just ignore it and get on with my job.&quot; He added: &quot;The only thing that annoys me after reading some reports is what the opposition locks think. &quot;I can just imagine them saying &#x27;I&#x27;m going to show this guy what&#x27;s what about second row play&#x27;. That&#x27;s the one thing that makes me cringe.&quot; O&#x27;Connell, who made a try-scoring international debut against <i>Wales</i> two years ago, is enjoying his meteoric rise into rugby&#x27;s shop window - but refuses to be drawn on the Lions.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I have spoken to Sir Clive Woodward a few times, but not for very long, certainly nothing about summer holidays,&quot; he joked. He also said he remains wary of wounded England&#x27;s abilities coming into Sunday&#x27;s game after two straight defeats, dismissing predictions of a certain Irish victory. &quot;It&#x27;s very dangerous to think that. This <i>England</i> team has so much experience and skill. You do not become a bad team overnight. &quot;They have two world class game-breakers in Josh Lewsey and Jason Robinson, while Charlie Hodgson is just ready to click into place.&quot; He insisted <i>Ireland</i> will not make the mistake of being over-confident. &quot;That&#x27;s not going to happen in our squad. No <i>Ireland</i> team lining up to play <i>England</i> will ever fall into that trap,&quot; he said. &quot;Every time we play <i>England</i> we know what a big task it is. Look at what they did to us two years ago. I remember that game all too well, and it was not a good feeling. &quot;I came on as a replacement and we were losing 13-6, and ended up getting hammered 42-6, so I know what can happen when <i>England</i> come to Dublin. &quot;They could so easily have been coming to Dublin with two wins and staring a Grand Slam in the face as well.&quot;</p>
