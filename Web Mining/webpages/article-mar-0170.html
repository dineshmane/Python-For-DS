			<p>Italy coach John Kirwan has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing <i>Ireland</i> close when they meet <i>Wales</i> on Saturday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Despite losing 28-17 in Sunday&#x27;s Six Nations encounter, the Italians confirmed their continuing improvement. &quot;Our goal is to match every side we face and against <i>Ireland</i> we showed we could do that,&quot; said Kirwan. &quot;But the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play <i>Wales</i> on Saturday.&quot; Italy&#x27;s half-backs had a mixed afternoon, with recalled scrum-half Alessandro Troncon impressing but fly-half Luciano Orquera having an off-day with the boot. Kirwan said: &quot;I was very happy with Troncon. He had an incredible game - he was very good in attack and defence. &quot;Orquera&#x27;s kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence. &quot;He also followed the game plan. We have to give him confidence because he has the capability to do well.&quot;</p>
