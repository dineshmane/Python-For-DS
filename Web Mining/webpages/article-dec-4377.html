					<b>Japan narrowly escapes recession</b><br><br>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Japan&#x27;s economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. &quot;I maintain the view that Japan&#x27;s economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,&quot; said economy minister Heizo Takenaka. But in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. &quot;It&#x27;s painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought,&quot; said Paul Sheard, economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. Improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand, with private consumption up just 0.2% in the third quarter.</p>
