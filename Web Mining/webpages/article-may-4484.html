					<b>O&#x27;Leary agrees new Villa contract</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Aston Villa boss David O&#x27;Leary signed a three-and-a-half year contract extension on Thursday, securing his future at the club until summer 2008.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s future was in question, but Villa chairman Doug Ellis said he was happy to secure the deal. &quot;David&#x27;s record since his arrival in 2003 is excellent and he shares the board&#x27;s amibitions in taking this club forward,&quot; he told Villa&#x27;s website. &quot;For this reason it was important we got this right.&quot; O&#x27;Leary put pen to paper after deals were sorted for his right-hand men Roy Aitken and Steve McGregor. &quot;It was important to me Roy and Steve, an integral part of my team, should stay for the same time,&quot; O&#x27;Leary said on Thursday ahead of signing his new deal. &quot;Someone has to try and put Aston Villa back where they should belong and I&#x27;m up for the challenge.&quot;Earlier in December, there were rumours O&#x27;Leary would quit if he is not offered a new deal before the end of the season.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>But he denied that, saying he was happy to take on the challenge of improving Villa&#x27;s fortunes in the long term. &quot;I want to make sure by the end of the five years I would have been in charge that Villa are achieving top six finishes in the Premiership on a regular basis,&quot; said O&#x27;Leary, who took over at Villa Park in May 2003. &quot;But to achieve that, and take the next step forward, we do need to bring in quality players. &quot;I would like a couple next month if at all possible to set us on the way.&quot; Meanwhile, O&#x27;Leary has rapped skipper Olof Mellberg for his comments before Sunday&#x27;s derby with Birmingham.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mellberg spoke of his dislike of Villa&#x27;s rivals ahead of the match, which Steve Bruce&#x27;s side won 2-1. &quot;I&#x27;ve had more than a quiet word with Olof. It&#x27;s been said within the whole group, not as a one-to-one,&quot; he told Villa&#x27;s website. &quot;You shouldn&#x27;t leave yourself open to be shot down. You shouldn&#x27;t give people the chance to take cheap shots at you and he set himself up for that.&quot;</p>
