		<h2>Web radio takes Spanish rap global</h2>
					<b>Web radio takes Spanish rap global</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. But what you will not find is much Spanish-language hip-hop.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the Spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. But now, a US company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. Los Caballeros de Plan G are one of Mexico&#x27;s hottest hip-hop acts. They have a devoted fan base in their native Monterrey. But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group&#x27;s tracks on the radio.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;You can&#x27;t really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it&#x27;s just not accessible,&quot; says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. &quot;It&#x27;s really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.&quot; Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing &quot;export quality&quot; rap.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its &quot;infant stage&quot;. But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina&#x27;s Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. &quot;He&#x27;s considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,&quot; Millan says. &quot;He really hasn&#x27;t had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he&#x27;s definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.&quot; Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com&#x27;s top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. &quot;Every country&#x27;s got it&#x27;s own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,&quot; Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station&#x27;s traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com&#x27;s top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. &quot;It&#x27;s basically him bragging that he&#x27;s one of the best emcees in Spain right now,&quot; Millan says. &quot;And it&#x27;s pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it&#x27;s amazing.&quot; Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. Millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of Spanish language hip-hop and rap.</p>
