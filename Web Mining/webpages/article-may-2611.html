		<h2>Parmalat to return to stockmarket</h2>
					<b>Parmalat to return to stockmarket</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Parmalat, the Italian dairy company which went bust after an accounting scandal, hopes to be back on the Italian stock exchange in July.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The firm gained protection from creditors in 2003 after revealing debts of 14bn euros ($18.34bn; Â£9.6bn). This was eight times higher than it had previously stated. In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Parmalat Finanziaria detailed administrators&#x27; latest plans for re-listing the shares of the group.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>As part of the re-listing on the Italian stock exchange, creditors&#x27; debts are expected to be converted into shares through two new share issues amounting to more than 2bn euros. The company&#x27;s creditors will be asked to vote on the plan later this year. The plan is likely to give creditors of Parmalat Finanziaria shares worth about 5.7% of the debts they are owed. This is lower than the 11.3% creditors previously hoped to receive. Creditors of Parmalat, the main operating company, are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%.</p>

			<p>Several former top Parmalat executives are under investigation for the fraud scandal. Lawmakers said on Wednesday night Enrico Bondi, the turnaround specialist appointed by the Italian government as Parmalat&#x27;s chief executive, spoke positively about the company during a closed-door hearing of the Chamber of Deputies industry commission. &quot;Bondi supplied us with elements of positive results on the industrial positions and on the history of debt which will find a point of solution through the Parmalat group&#x27;s quotation on the market in July,&quot; Italian news agency Apcom quoted several lawmakers as saying in a statement.</p>
