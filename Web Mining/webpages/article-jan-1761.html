			<p>US behemoth General Electric has posted an 18% jump in quarterly sales, and in profits, and declared itself &quot;in great shape&quot;.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;We are benefiting from our growth initiatives and an excellent global economy,&quot; said GE&#x27;s chief executive Jeff Immelt. GE is the US&#x27; biggest firm based on stock market valuation. GE&#x27;s net profits were $5.37bn (Â£2.86bn) for the final three months of 2004, while sales came in at $43.7bn. The group, whose businesses range from jet engines to the NBC television channel, forecast sustained growth at between 10-15% for this year and next. GE&#x27;s shares rose 1% on the news before ending Friday 0.24% lower.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The industries GE is in are doing very well. The materials, financial and industrial sectors are all picking up,&quot; said Steve Roukis, an analyst at fund manager Matrix Asset Advisors, which has shares in GE. GE said orders in the fourth quarter were 15% higher than in the same period of 2003, &quot;with growth across the board&quot;. &quot;In the fourth quarter, nine of our 11 businesses delivered at least double-digit earnings growth,&quot; said Mr Immelt. Full year 2004 gains were less spectacular, but still respectable. Net profit was up 6% at $16.6bn. Last year, GE bought Vivendi Universal, merging it with NBC to form NBC Universal. The success of Universal Studio&#x27;s film &#x27;Ray&#x27;, a portrait of jazz musician Ray Charles, has helped boost earnings at the unit.</p>
