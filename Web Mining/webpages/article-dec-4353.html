					<p>Stevens named in England line-up</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>England have named Bath prop Matt Stevens in the starting line-up for their Six Nations match against Ireland at Lansdowne Road on Sunday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Fellow Bath prop Duncan Bell will start on the bench, as coach Andy Robinson makes just one change to the team that was beaten by France. It will be Stevens&#x27; first start after two caps as a replacement against the All Blacks last year. Leicester duo Ollie Smith and Andy Goode have been drafted onto the bench. Stevens takes over from Phil Vickery, who suffered a broken arm playing for Gloucester last weekend. &quot;I&#x27;m confident Matt will grasp this opportunity and make his mark against Ireland,&quot; said Robinson.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;All three players have shown outstanding form of late, most recently in the England A win against France A and for their club,&quot; added Robinson. &quot;Selection beckons when players demonstrate such consistent ability. &quot;This game against Ireland will be massive. We recognise it&#x27;s a must-win game for us this season.&quot; England confirmed that Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan was not considered for selection because of an injury he picked up to the back of his ankle during last Friday&#x27;s match against Leeds.</p>
			<p></p>

			<p>J Robinson (Sale Sharks, capt); M Cueto (Sale Sharks), J Noon (Newcastle), O Barkley (Bath), J Lewsey (Wasps); C Hodgson (Sale Sharks), H Ellis (Leicester); G Rowntree (Leicester), S Thompson (Northampton), M Stevens (Bath), D Grewcock (Bath), B Kay (Leicester), J Worsley (Wasps), L Moody (Leicester), M Corry (Leicester).</p>
