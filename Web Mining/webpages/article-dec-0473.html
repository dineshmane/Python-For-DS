					<p>Glaxo aims high after profit fall</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>GlaxoSmithKline saw its profits fall 9% last year to £6.2bn ($11.5bn), but Europe&#x27;s biggest drugmaker says a recovery during 2005 is on the way.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Cheap copies of its drugs, particularly anti-depressants Paxil and Wellbutrin, and a weak dollar had hit profits, but global sales were up 1% in 2004. The firm is confident its new drug pipeline will deliver profits despite the failure of an obesity drug. Chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier said it had been a &quot;difficult year&quot;.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>In early afternoon trade in London the company share price was down 1% at 1218 pence. Mr Garnier said the company had absorbed over £1.5bn of lost sales to generics but still managing to grow the business. &quot;The continuing success of our key products means we can now look forward to a good performance in 2005,&quot; he said. &quot;2005 will also be an important year in terms of research and development pipeline progress.&quot; However, the firm discontinued development of an experimental treatment for obesity, known as &#x27;771, after disappointing clinical trial results. Glaxo is relying on new treatments for conditions such as cancer, diabetes, depression, HIV/AIDS and allergies to lift the pace of sales growth after several disappointing years.</p>
