					<p>Keane defiant over Vieira bust-up</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Manchester United captain Roy Keane has insisted that he does not regret his tunnel bust-up with Arsenal&#x27;s Patrick Vieira - and would do the same again.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Keane clashed with midfield rival Vieira before United&#x27;s 4-2 win in the fiery match at Highbury on 1 February. The Irishman stepped in to protect United defender Gary Neville, who rowed with Vieira before the match. &quot;I&#x27;d had enough of Vieira&#x27;s behaviour and I would do what I did again tomorrow if I had to,&quot; said Keane. Keane admitted that Neville may also have been at fault over the incident, which added further ill-feeling to an already-tense atmosphere. &quot;It takes two to tango. Maybe Gary deserves to be chased up a tunnel every now and then - there would be a queue for him, probably,&quot; he added. &quot;But you have to draw a line eventually.&quot; Keane said the trouble between Vieira and Neville was more serious than mere name-calling. &quot;I&#x27;m usually first out in the tunnel but I had a problem with my shorts and I was maybe fourth or fifth out and by the time I got down I saw Vieira getting right into Gary Neville again,&quot; he said. &quot;I mean physically as well now. I don&#x27;t mean verbally.&quot;</p>
