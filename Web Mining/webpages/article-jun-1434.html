		<h2>M&amp;S cuts prices by average of 24%</h2>
					<b>M&amp;S cuts prices by average of 24%</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Marks &amp; Spencer has cut prices in London and the regions by an average of 24%, according to research from a City investment bank.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said: &quot;In spite of the snow in the UK, it still feels very early to be cutting prices of spring merchandise.&quot; Stuart Rose, head of M&amp;S, said last year its prices were too high. &quot;We are bringing in ranges at new price points to compete against mid-market retailers like Next,&quot; said M&amp;S.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Next is one of M&amp;S&#x27;s biggest competitors and the move may force it to lower prices. DrKW said the cuts are either to clear stock or could indicate a longer term &quot;step change in pricing in certain areas&quot; at M&amp;S. &quot;Either way, this cannot be good news for M&amp;S&#x27; margin,&quot; it added. &quot;We have brought in quite a lot of new clothing at new price points as part of Stuart Rose&#x27;s strategy of quality, style -and price,&quot; said the M&amp;S spokesman. Many analysts believe February is proving to be a difficult month for retailers and British Retail Consortium figures, due in a few weeks, are expected to reflect the tough trading environment. Separately, investment bank Goldman Sachs produced reseach showing that a basket of 35 M&amp;S goods is now 11% above the high-street average, compared with 43% higher last year.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>It has been a strange week for M&amp;S, which on Tuesday received a statement from Philip Green, the billionaire Bhs owner, confirming he was not rebidding for the company. This was followed the same day by Mark Paulsmeier, a South African financier, issuing a press release saying his Paulsmeier Group was interested in M&amp;S. A sudden spike in M&amp;S&#x27;s share price followed. However, an M&amp;S spokesman said on Sunday it had no evidence that Mr Paulsmeier had lined up sufficient finance for a bid. He also said the Takeover Panel and the UK&#x27;s financial watchdog the Financial Services Authority had been in touch with M&amp;S at the beginning of the week to find out what it knew about the Paulsmeier developments.</p>
