					<b>GM in crunch talks on Fiat future</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Fiat will meet car giant General Motors (GM) on Tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the Italian firm&#x27;s loss-making auto group.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Fiat claims that GM is legally obliged to buy the 90% of the car unit it does not already own; GM says the contract, signed in 2000, is no longer valid. Press reports have speculated that Fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim. Both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The meeting between Fiat boss Sergio Marchionne and GM&#x27;s Rick Wagoner is due to take place at 1330 GMT in Zurich, according to the Online News news agency.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mr Marchionne is confident of his firm&#x27;s legal position, saying in an interview with the Financial Times that GM&#x27;s argument &quot;has no legs&quot;. The agreement in question dates back to GM&#x27;s decision to buy 20% of Fiat&#x27;s auto division in 2000. At the time, it gave the Italian firm the right, via a &#x27;put option&#x27;, to sell the remaining stake to GM. In recent weeks, Fiat has reiterated its claims that this &#x27;put&#x27; is still valid and legally binding. However, GM argues that a Fiat share sale made last year, which cut GM&#x27;s holding to 10%, together with asset sales made by Fiat have terminated the agreement.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Selling the Fiat&#x27;s car-making unit may not prove so simple, analysts say, especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to Italy&#x27;s industrial heritage. Political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise. &quot;We are not expecting Fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling GM at this point,&quot; brokerage Merrill Lynch said in a note to investors, adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business. &quot;As far as we are aware, the Agnelli family, which indirectly controls at least 30% of Fiat, has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business. &quot;Fiat may be willing to cancel the &#x27;put&#x27; in exchange for money.&quot;</p>
