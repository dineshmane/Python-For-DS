					<b>UK homes hit £3.3 trillion total</b><br><br>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>The value of the UK&#x27;s housing stock reached the £3.3 trillion mark in 2004 - triple the value 10 years earlier, a report indicates.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Research from Halifax, the country&#x27;s biggest mortgage lender, suggests the value of private housing stock is continuing to rise steadily. All regions saw at least a doubling in their assets during the past decade. But Northern Ireland led the way with a 262% rise, while <i>Scotland</i> saw the smallest increase of just 112%.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The core retail price index rose by just 28% in the same period, underlining how effective an investment in housing has been for most people during the past decade. More than a third of the UK&#x27;s private housing assets - representing more than a trillion pounds in value - are concentrated in London and the South East, the Halifax&#x27;s figures indicate. Tim Crawford, Group Economist at Halifax, said: &quot;The value of the private housing stock continues to grow and the family home remains, by a large margin, the most valuable asset of the majority of households in the UK.&quot; Halifax&#x27;s own monthly figures on house sales - issued on Thursday - suggest the average price of a British property now stands at £163,748 after a 0.8% rise in January. Housing experts are split on prospects for the market, with some saying price growth will slow but not fall, while others predict a sharp drop in values.</p>
