					<b>Renault boss hails &#x27;great year&#x27;</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Strong sales outside western Europe helped Renault boost its profits by more than 40% in 2004 although the firm warned of lower margins this year.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>France&#x27;s second largest carmaker enjoyed a healthy 43% rise in net profits to 2.4bn euros ($3.1bn; Â£2.9bn) as sales rose 8% to 40.7bn euros. The firm said strong demand outside western Europe and the good performance of its Megane range lifted its results. Chairman Louis Schweitzer said 2004 had been a &quot;great year&quot; for the firm.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Renault sold more than 2.4 million vehicles in 2004, an increase of 4% on the previous year. Growth came mainly from outside western Europe, with particularly strong sales in Turkey, Russia and North Africa.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>In total, sales outside western Europe - Renault&#x27;s core market - rose 16.5%. Japanese carmaker Nissan - in which Renault owns a 44% stake - contributed 1.7bn euros in net income over the year. Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn is to succeed Mr Schweitzer at the head of Renault later this year.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Renault said the outlook for the industry in Europe this year was &quot;stable&quot;, with small growth forecast in other regions. The firm will benefit from the launch of a new Clio model in the coming year and the roll-out of the Logan in many markets. However, the firm said it expected operating margins to be lower in 2005, at 4% of sales as opposed to 5%. &quot;In a sluggish market and an environment impacted by the rise in raw material prices, Renault intends to continue to grow its global sales,&quot; the company said in a statement.</p>
