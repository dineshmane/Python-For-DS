					<p>Downing injury mars Uefa victory</p>

			<p>Middlesbrough boss Steve McClaren hopes that Stewart Downing did not seriously damage his hamstring during the 2-1 Uefa Cup win over Graz AK.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>The winger was carried off on a stretcher in the closing stages as Boro booked their place in the last 16. McClaren said: &quot;Stewart has tweaked a hamstring, which is a blow for us. We will assess it in the morning. &quot;But I&#x27;m delighted with the match result. They say in sport you can win ugly - and we certainly did.&quot; McClaren was relieved to make it through after a tough encounter at The Riverside.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;To be fair to Graz, they had a gameplan - they knocked the ball forward, especially in the first half, and we struggled to deal with it. &quot;In the second half we were better but it was frustrating because we got the goal - but one slip and they were back in it.&quot; Boro face Sporting Lisbon for a place in the quarter-finals after the Portuguese side saw off Feyenoord on Thursday. And McClaren added: &quot;Sporting are technically very good - Portuguese sides always are. &quot;But the journey goes on for us and we will now go to their magnificent stadium - after the first game here - we&#x27;ll look forward to it.&quot; Goalscorer Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink added: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a particularly beautiful match to watch - but they made it difficult for us. &quot;We didn&#x27;t play well at all. But you need a little bit of luck and I think we got that when my shot went through the legs of their goalkeeper. &quot;I would have liked to play in Holland - that would have been a little bit special to me. &quot;But so is going back to Portugal - I&#x27;ll be playing against some lads I played with at Boavista.&quot;</p>
