					<p>Gardener battles to narrow win</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Jason Gardener fought all the way to the line to narrowly claim the men&#x27;s 60m title at the Norwich Union Indoor trials and AAAs Championships.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The world 60m champion got off to a rolling start and had to dig deep to dip ahead of Mark Findlay and Darren Chin, who both set personal bests. &quot;It was a close race,&quot; admitted Gardener. &quot;I stumbled out the blocks but my experience told through. &quot;I still feel there&#x27;s more life in me and I believe I can go faster.&quot; Gardener&#x27;s performance in Sheffield could have been affected by the news, which he heard before his semi-final, that his European record had been broken Frenchman Ronald Pognon, who will be a real threat at the European Championships, set a new time of 6.45, one-hundreth of a second faster than Gardener&#x27;s previous mark. Favourite</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>delivered a powerful performance to take the women&#x27;s 60m title in 7.27 seconds. &quot;You&#x27;ll see me in Madrid and I feel there is a lot more to come along,&quot; said the 22-year-old. Katherine Endacott battled hard to take second and dip under the European qualifying mark. Defending champion Joice Maduaka had pulled out of the final with a chest infection.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>was on record-breaking form as she stormed to the women&#x27;s 60m hurdles crown. The 25-year-old set a new British record for the second time in seven days, clocking 7.96 seconds to finish ahead of rival Diane Allahgreen. &quot;I&#x27;m so happy,&quot; a tearful Claxton told Online News Sport. &quot;All the years I&#x27;ve been running and I&#x27;m getting recognition.&quot; Claxton&#x27;s time was also good enough to qualify for the European Championships.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The men&#x27;s 800m went to form in Sheffield as</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>dominated the race from start to finish. The Northern <i>Ireland</i> athlete went off at a startling pace but had to hold off the challenge of Welshman Jimmy Watkins over the final 200m to win in one minute, 47.96 seconds. Both McIlory and Watkins, who set a life-time best of 1:48.32, had already booked their places in Madrid and were again well within the qualifying time. &quot;I had to go out and go through all the gears before the Europeans and I won&#x27;t run again until then,&quot; said McIlroy.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>could not reach the European mark in the women&#x27;s race as she crossed the line to win in 2:04.45. Olympic bronze heptathlon medallist</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>rounded off a useful weekend with two more personal bests in Sheffield. The 28-year-old reached 1.80m in the high jump and clocked 8.47secs in the heats of the 60m hurdles. &quot;I&#x27;ve surprised myself,&quot; said Sotherton. &quot;I&#x27;m starting to thrive on the pressure but if I don&#x27;t perform then it&#x27;s not the end of the world.&quot; Pole vaulter</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>made a winning return to major competition after a drugs ban. The Trafford athlete, who has served a two-year ban after testing positive for anabolic steroids, clinched the title with a championship record 4.25m.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>also set a new championship mark in the men&#x27;s triple jump title in Sheffield. The 26-year-old, who has been training in Australia over the winter, landed 17.30m with his final effort - the longest leap in the world this year. &quot;I didn&#x27;t have a clue,&quot; said Idowu. &quot;I&#x27;ve not jumped indoors before and I just wanted the qualifying mark. &quot;But this isn&#x27;t a bad start and hopefully I&#x27;ll come back from Madrid with a gold medal.&quot; Nathan Douglas continued his steady progress this season as he set a life-time best of 16.76m in second while Jonathan Moore took third.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>and</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>resumed their rivalry in the long jump competition, both achieving the European standard. Commonwealth champion Morgan reached a personal best of 7.96m on his very first jump and then promptly retired with a bruised heel. Olympian Tomlinson tried to play catch up with his six jumps but had to settle for a season&#x27;s best jump of 7.91m. &quot;I was advised not to jump by my doctor and so I&#x27;m pleased to come here and get the qualifying mark,&quot; said Tomlinson.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>, now based at Loughborough, sprinted past front runner Catherine Murphy in the final 100m to steal the women&#x27;s 400m title. The 21-year-old ran a personal best of 53.45 seconds to win her first indoor title. Wall&#x27;s time was just short of the qualifying mark - something Murphy already has. Ireland&#x27;s</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>took the men&#x27;s title in 46.46 ahead of promising Channel Islands decathlete Dale Garland. Sudanese 18-year-old Rabah Yusuf, who is seeking British citizenship, showed his raw talent as he burst through in third.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>cleared the required 1.90m to qualify for the European championships and claim the AAAs title in the women&#x27;s high jump. In the men&#x27;s 3,000m,</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>powered to a new personal best of seven minutes, 56.86 seconds to defend his AAAs title in style. It was the first time in 11 years the eight-minute barrier has been broken at the championships and was just within the European mark.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>took the women&#x27;s 1500m AAAs title in the absence of Kelly Holmes. Her time of 4:19.11 was not good enough to qualify for Madrid but Ovens had already opted out of the championships. The men&#x27;s race was won by</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>, who had to fight off a closing pack to claim the title in 3:45.87.</p>
