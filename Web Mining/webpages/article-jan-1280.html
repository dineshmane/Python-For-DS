					<p>Gardener wins double in Glasgow</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Britain&#x27;s Jason Gardener enjoyed a double 60m success in Glasgow in his first competitive outing since he won 100m relay gold at the Athens Olympics.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>Gardener cruised home ahead of Scot Nick Smith to win the invitational race at the Norwich Union International. He then recovered from a poor start in the second race to beat Swede Daniel Persson and Italy&#x27;s Luca Verdecchia. His times of 6.61 and 6.62 seconds were well short of American Maurice Greene&#x27;s 60m world record of 6.39secs from 1998. &quot;It&#x27;s a very hard record to break, but I believe I&#x27;ve trained very well,&quot; said the world indoor champion, who hopes to get closer to the mark this season. &quot;It was important to come out and make sure I got maximum points. My last race was the Olympic final and there was a lot of expectation. &quot;This was just what I needed to sharpen up and get some race fitness. I&#x27;m very excited about the next couple of months.&quot;</p>

			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>took the win for Russia. And the 31-year-old also missed out on a podium place in the 4x200m relay as the British quartet came in fourth, with Russia setting a new world indoor record. There was a setback for Jade Johnson as she suffered a recurrence of her back injury in the long jump. Russia won the meeting with a final total of 63 points, with Britain second on 48 and France one point behind in third.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>led the way for Russia by producing a major shock in the high jump as he beat Olympic champion Stefan Holm into second place to end the Swede&#x27;s 22-event unbeaten record.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>won the triple jump with a leap of 16.87m, with Britain&#x27;s Tosin Oke fourth in 15.80m.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>won the men&#x27;s pole vault competition with a clearance of 5.65m, with Britain&#x27;s Nick Buckfield 51cm adrift of his personal best in third. And</p>

			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>won the women&#x27;s 800m, with Britain&#x27;s Jenny Meadows third. There was yet another Russian victory in the women&#x27;s 400m as</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>finished well clear of Britain&#x27;s Catherine Murphy. Chris Lambert had to settle for fourth after fading in the closing stages of the men&#x27;s 200m race as Sweden&#x27;s</p>

			<p>won the men&#x27;s 400m, with Brett Rund fourth for Britain.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>took victory for Sweden in the women&#x27;s 60m hurdles ahead of Russia&#x27;s Irina Shevchenko and Britain&#x27;s Sarah Claxton, who set a new personal best. Italy grabbed their first victory in the men&#x27;s 1500m as</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>kicked over the last 200 metres to hold off Britain&#x27;s James Thie and France&#x27;s Alexis Abraham. A botched changeover in the 4x200m relay cost Britain&#x27;s men the chance to add further points as France claimed victory.</p>
