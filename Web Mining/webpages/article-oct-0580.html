		<h2>Scotland 18-10 Italy</h2>
					<p>Scotland 18-10 Italy</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Six Chris Paterson penalties gave <i>Scotland</i> victory in a dour but clinical encounter against Italy at Murrayfield.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Coach Matt Williams&#x27; side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. Paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and <i>Scotland</i> were denied a try when wing Sean Lamont&#x27;s touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. A late Andrea Masi try was small consolation for Italy, chasing their first away win in the Six Nations. <i>Scotland</i> came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back Paterson. But the more powerful Azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>A series of drives into Scottish territory set up a penalty attempt, missed by full-back Roland De Marigny, and a wayward drop-goal effort from Luciano Orquera. <i>Scotland</i> defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes Italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a De Marigny penalty. Italy were offered another penalty when Scottish flanker Simon Taylor was offside but the left-footed De Marigny pushed his kick wide. <i>Scotland</i> finally made the most of a rare foray into the Italian half and snatched three points from Paterson when an Italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>As the half wore on, both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties, and the period fizzled out with <i>Scotland</i> numerically, if not psychologically, on top. Italy&#x27;s De Marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. And <i>Scotland</i> capitalised with a third Paterson penalty on 50 minutes. Williams&#x27; side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and, after a couple of probing attacks, Paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>With the pendulum of possession swinging towards Scotland, Lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from Paterson. Another Paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. But John Kirwan&#x27;s men had the last laugh when Gordon Ross&#x27; attempted clearance was charged down and Masi pounced for the try, converted by De Marigny.</p>
