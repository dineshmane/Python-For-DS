			<p>US retail sales fell 0.3% in January, the biggest monthly decline since last August, driven down by a heavy fall in car sales.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 3.3% fall in car sales had been expected, coming after December&#x27;s 4% rise in car sales, fuelled by generous pre-Christmas special offers. Excluding the car sector, US retail sales were up 0.6% in January, twice what some analysts had been expecting. US retail spending is expected to rise in 2005, but not as quickly as in 2004.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Steve Gallagher, US chief economist at SG Corporate &amp; Investment Banking, said January&#x27;s figures were &quot;decent numbers&quot;.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;We are not seeing the numbers that we saw in the second half of 2004, but they are still pretty healthy,&quot; he added. Sales at appliance and electronic stores were down 0.6% in January, while sales at hardware stores dropped by 0.3% and furniture store sales dipped 0.1%. Sales at clothing and clothing accessory stores jumped 1.8%, while sales at general merchandise stores, a category that includes department stores, rose by 0.9%. These strong gains were in part put down to consumers spending gift vouchers they had been given for Christmas.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Sales at restaurants, bars and coffee houses rose by 0.3%, while grocery store sales were up 0.5%. In December, overall retail sales rose by 1.1%. Excluding the car sector, sales rose by just 0.3%. Parul Jain, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said consumer spending would continue to rise in 2005, only at a slower rate of growth than in 2004. &quot;Consumers continue to retain their strength in the first quarter,&quot; he said. Van Rourke, a bond strategist at Popular Securities, agreed that the latest retail sales figures were &quot;slightly stronger than expected&quot;.</p>
