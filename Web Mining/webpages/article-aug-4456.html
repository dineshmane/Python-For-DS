			<p>Wales coach Mike Ruddock says John Yapp has what it takes as an international.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 21-year-old Blues prop is the only uncapped player in Wales&#x27; Six Nations squad, gaining a chance in the absence of Ospreys loose-head Duncan Jones. &quot;John is a young man with a big future. He has been playing with the Blues for two years and has racked up mileage on his playing clock,&quot; said Ruddock. &quot;He has international size, is a big, physical lad and a good ball-carrier with a high tackle-count.&quot; Ruddock&#x27;s assessment was backed up by Yapp&#x27;s coach at the Blues, former <i>Wales</i> and Lions prop Dai Young.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;John&#x27;s been on an upward curve all season and is going from strength to strength,&quot; Young told Online News Sport Wales. &quot;His ball carrying gives us good go-forward, he impresses in defence and his work-rate is excellent. &quot;He&#x27;s working hard on his scrummaging technique, which he is keen to improve to become a destroyer on the loose-head. &quot;To be fair to him he&#x27;s not quite there with the scrummaging yet, but nobody can fault his effort, commitment and attitude. &quot;John&#x27;s a very strong man and is eager for the challenge, if he&#x27;s pitched in he won&#x27;t let anyone down. &quot;He&#x27;s developing quickly, but I hope he isn&#x27;t pushed too quickly in a way that would hurt his development.&quot;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ruddock hopes that the selection of Yapp and Dragons lock Ian Gough - out of the international reckoning since falling out with former coach Steve Hansen - will send a message to other players in Wales. &quot;John and Ian have been rewarded for impressing during the Heineken Cup competition,&quot; said Ruddock. &quot;Both of them have played well, and we want to send a message out that consistently playing well gets you in the squad. &quot;We believe this is an exciting squad representing traditional values of Welsh rugby, and based on the performances in the November internationals. &quot;We have strength and experience up front, and well-recognised talent, pace and skill behind. &quot;The management team just want to get hold of the players and get out on the training pitch at the moment. &quot;They are all due in on Sunday, and that&#x27;s when the hard work starts.&quot;</p>
