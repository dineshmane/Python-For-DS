		<h2>Moore questions captaincy</h2>
					<p>Moore questions captaincy</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Brian Moore believes the England captain should not be a full-back.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Jason Robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the Six Nations tournament, in the absence of fly-half Jonny Wilkinson. The world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain Martin Johnson, a lock forward. And former England captain Moore told the Online News: &quot;Full-backs are too far away from the action. That&#x27;s not a reflection on Robinson personally.&quot; He added: &quot;I just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack - which is, after all, where games usually start and finish.&quot; Moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why England have lost against Wales, France and <i>Ireland</i> in this year&#x27;s tournament. &quot;Assertiveness in the pack isn&#x27;t there, we&#x27;re not getting enough people into the breakdowns,&quot; he explained. &quot;Wer&#x27;e not getting quick ball, which means the backs are being stifled. Their creativity depends on quick ball and we&#x27;re not getting that.&quot;</p>

			<p>With injuries depriving him of key players like Wilkinson, coach Andy Robinson has given youngsters such as Harry Ellis and Jamie Noon a chance. And Moore believes the last two games against Italy and Scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further. &quot;The problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don&#x27;t have the requisite experience,&quot; Moore added. &quot;You can&#x27;t do anything about that but play them. There are players who have been knocking on the door, it&#x27;s time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there&#x27;s nothing on them. &quot;We then go into next season with a greater certainty of who can and cannot handle the pressure of international rugby.&quot;</p>
