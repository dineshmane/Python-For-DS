					<b>Verizon &#x27;seals takeover of MCI&#x27;</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Verizon has won a takeover battle for US phone firm MCI with a bid worth $6.8bn (Â£3.6bn), reports say.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning, according to news agency reports, despite what was thought to be a higher bid from Qwest. The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&amp;T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn. MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under previous name WorldCom. The bankruptcy followed its admission in 2002 that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. Qwest has itself come under suspicion of sub-standard behaviour, paying the Securities and Exchange Commission $250m in October to settle charges that it manipulated its results to keep Wall Street happy.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>MCI is the US&#x27;s second-biggest long distance firm after AT&amp;T. Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. A merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October. Last week, SBC Communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer AT&amp;T for about $16bn. Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI&#x27;s global network and business-based subscribers. The rationale is similar to the one underpinning SBC&#x27;s AT&amp;T deal. Verizon is by far the bigger company and has its own successful mobile arm - factors which may have swung the board in its favour since both suitors are offering a mixture of cash and shares.</p>
