					<p>Bargain calls widen Softbank loss</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Japanese communications firm Softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The service, launched in December and dubbed &quot;Otoku&quot; or &quot;bargain&quot;, has had almost 900,000 orders, Softbank said. The firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to December of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; Â£38.4m). But without the Otoku marketing spend it would have made a profit - and expects to move into the black in 2006. The firm did not give a figure for the extent of profits it expected to make next year. It was born in the 1990s tech boom, investing widely and becoming a fast-rising star, till the end of the tech bubble hit it hard. Its recent return to a high profile came with the purchase of Japan Telecom, the country&#x27;s third-biggest fixed-line telecoms firm. The acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the Japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of December.</p>
