			<p>Instead of the stairs, you use an elevator to get to your office. You work on your desktop computer or laptop and use a smartphone. You use your credit card to pay for lunch. Technology became gradually part of our life, so it is normal that professional sports also started to exploit its possibilities.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>In Formula–1, cycling, swimming, or athletics professional timer services have appeared, thus making every thousandth of a second count. The hawk–eye technique has helped track the trajectory of balls in cricket since 2001 and in tennis since 2004. In the video replay, we can clearly see whether the ball was in or out. The performance of football players has been measured and assessed by a method introduced by UEFA in 2007. Sixteen cameras monitor the field so that officials are able to follow the trajectories of the players and the ball accurately. Goal–line technology assists ice hockey and football referees decide whether the ball was in or out. In American football referees can re–watch a play when the call is close. In basketball the NBA uses replay vision to review last–touch decisions in the final two minutes of the game.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Technology gathers data about every second of the game and every second of the performance of the players. Data helps to analyze, create new strategies and thus boost players’ performance in the arena. But is it everything technology could offer professional sportsmen and sportswomen?</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The answer is certainly no. Technology can boost talent, health management as well as coaching – the three factors which matter in sport.</p>
