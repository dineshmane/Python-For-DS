					<p>Van Nistelrooy hungry for return</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy said he was &quot;hungry to play&quot; as he returned to training on Tuesday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The Dutch striker, 28, is closing in on a comeback after nearly three months out with an Achilles injury. &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to get back training and meet up with my team-mates again,&quot; he told the Daily Mirror newspaper. &quot;I&#x27;m ahead of schedule and I&#x27;ve made good progress with my physio in Holland. I have been away from United for a long time, but I&#x27;m fit again.&quot; United boss Sir Alex Ferguson hinted at a return for Van Nistelrooy in the FA Cup fifth round tie at Everton on Saturday. He said: &quot;There is a chance he could be involved at Everton but we&#x27;ll just have to see how he comes through training.&quot; United did not lose any of the 14 games in which Van Nistelrooy was involved before his injury - although their form has remained good since he was sidelined. Their 2-0 derby win at Manchester City on Sunday made it 13 wins in 15 league games.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>However, Van Nistelrooy is still the club&#x27;s top scorer this season with 12 goals, despite being out since the 3-0 win against West Brom on 27 November. United have also been hit by injuries to both Alan Smith and Louis Saha during Van Nistelrooy&#x27;s absence, meaning Wayne Rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front. The teenager has responded with six goals in nine games, including the first goal against City on Sunday.</p>
