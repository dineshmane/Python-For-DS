		<h2>Wales silent on Grand Slam talk</h2>
					<p>Wales silent on Grand Slam talk</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Rhys Williams says <i>Wales</i> are still not thinking of winning the Grand Slam despite a third Six Nations win.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the last thing on our minds at the moment,&quot; said Williams, a second- half replacement in Saturday&#x27;s 24-18 win over France in Paris. &quot;We all realise how difficult a task it is to go up to <i>Scotland</i> and beat them. &quot;We&#x27;ve come unstuck there a couple of times recently so our focus is on that game and we&#x27;ll worry about Ireland hopefully after we&#x27;ve beaten Scotland.&quot; With captain Gareth Thomas ruled out of the rest of the campaign with a broken thumb, Williams is vying for his first start in the championship so far.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>Kevin Morgan is probably favourite to replace Thomas at full-back, leaving Williams and Hal Luscombe to battle for the right wing berth. A hamstring injury denied Luscombe the opportunity to make a third successive start, but the Dragons winger is expected to be fit for the trip to Murrayfield on 13 March. Hooker Robin McBryde is doubtful after picking up a knee injury in Paris, but centre Sonny Parker and flanker Colin Charvis are set to recover from injury to be in contention for selection. Said <i>Wales</i> assistant coach Scott Johnson: &quot;They&#x27;ve worked through the weekend and the reports are a bit more positive. &quot;So we&#x27;re getting a couple back and that adds to the depth of the squad.&quot; <i>Scotland</i> secured their first win of the campaign on Saturday by grinding out an 18-10 win over Italy.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Matt Williams&#x27; side has shown little in attack, but Johnson insisted the Scots will be difficult opposition to break down. &quot;Italy are really brave opposition and sometimes it&#x27;s very hard to win,&quot; he said. &quot;So an ugly win can be just as effective as a 30 or 40 point victory. &quot;Scotland are a hard side and very underrated so we&#x27;re not taking anything for granted. &quot;We&#x27;re not basking in the glory of winning our first three games. We&#x27;ve got to be diligent in our preparation. &quot;That&#x27;s my job and we&#x27;ve got to make sure we&#x27;re focused.&quot;</p>
