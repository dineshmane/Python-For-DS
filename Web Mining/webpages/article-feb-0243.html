		<h2>Wall Street cool to eBay&#x27;s profit</h2>
					<b>Wall Street cool to eBay&#x27;s profit</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Shares in online auction house eBay fell 9.8% in after-hours trade on Wednesday, after its quarterly profits failed to meet market expectations.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Despite seeing net profits rise by 44% to $205.4m (Â£110m) during October to December, from $142m a year earlier, Wall Street had expected more. EBay stock fell to $92.9 in after-hours trade, from a $103.05 end on Nasdaq. EBay&#x27;s net revenue for the quarter rose to $935.8m from $648.4m, boosted by growth at its PayPal payment service.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Excluding special items, eBay&#x27;s profit was 33 cents a share, but analysts had expected 34 cents.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I think Wall Street has gotten a bit ahead of eBay this quarter and for the 2005 year.&quot; said Janco Partners analyst Martin Pyykkonen. For 2004 as a whole, eBay earned $778.2m on sales of $3.27bn. EBay president and chief executive Meg Whitman called 2004 an &quot;outstanding success&quot; that generated &quot;tremendous momentum&quot; for 2005. &quot;I&#x27;m more confident than ever that the decisions and investments we&#x27;re making today will ensure a bright future for the company and our community of users around the world,&quot; she said. EBay now forecasts 2005 revenue of $4.2bn to $4.35bn and earnings excluding items of $1.48 to $1.52 per share. Analysts had previously estimated that eBay would achieve 2005 revenues of $4.37bn and earnings of $1.62 per share, excluding items.</p>
