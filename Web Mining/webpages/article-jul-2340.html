					<p>Cantona issues Man Utd job hint</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Former Manchester United star Eric Cantona would consider returning to the club as manager one day.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But the Frenchman, who made 191 United appearances, would not come back if he felt he could not be creative. &quot;I will not return in the near future,&quot; he told MUTV. &quot;If I come back I will need to be involved in football for two or three years because things change. &quot;I do not want to be a manager like everybody else, playing the same system. I want to create something.&quot; Cantona says that he would like to follow in the footsteps of Johan Cruyff, who was an innovative coach when he led Barcelona to European Cup glory in 1992.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I remember the 1970s with Ajax and after that Cruyff as a manager at Barcelona,&quot; Cantona added. &quot;It was a new system. &quot;It is like in music - when you are a rock star and create something new.&quot; The 38-year-old also stated that he is against American tycoon Malcolm Glazer&#x27;s attempt to take over the club.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I am against this kind of thing because I am like a child - I am a dreamer. I don&#x27;t want these kind of people to come here,&quot; he said. &quot;If it is not Manchester United, if it is not a club where he can earn so much money, do you think he would love to come?&quot; Meanwhile, Cantona is at the centre of a storm after using an obscenity on MUTV on Sunday. Cantona was appearing on a show where supporters quiz guests and it was broadcast at 5.30pm. United apologised but have insisted that they have yet to receive a single complaint about Cantona&#x27;s comments.</p>
