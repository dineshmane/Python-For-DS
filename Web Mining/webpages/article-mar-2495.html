					<b>Calder fears for Scottish rugby</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Former Scotland international Finlay Calder fears civil war at the SRU could seriously hamper his country&#x27;s RBS Six Nations campaign.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Four members of the executive board, including the chairman, David Mackay, have resigned after a simmering row. And Calder said: &quot;This is terrible news for every level of Scottish rugby. &quot;David is a successful businessman and I thought that if anybody could transform the negative atmosphere and rising debt level, it was him.&quot; Mackay&#x27;s executive board has been in a power struggle with the general committee, which contains members elected by Scotland&#x27;s club sides. &quot;He has been driven out by people who seem happier waging civil war than addressing the central issue that professional rugby can&#x27;t be run by amateurs,&quot; said Calder.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;In fact, I don&#x27;t understand why we are still having this argument 10 years after professionalism arrived. &quot;But I don&#x27;t believe the rest of the SRU will take this lying down. &quot;I think the banks will be dismayed at this decision and, ultimately, it is them who pull the strings. &quot;So I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they reviewed their position. But, in the wider picture, what message does this send out?&quot; He thought the work of Scotland&#x27;s coaches, who have been attempting to arrest the decline of the national side, would be made much more difficult. &quot;Matt Williams and Willie Anderson must be wondering, &#x27;what have we walked into here?&#x27;&quot; said Calder. &quot;And we can now expect weeks of arguments and acrimony just at a time when we should be looking forward to the Six Nations Championship. &quot;I am very, very disappointed, more than you can imagine. Why do so many Scots have this knack of turning on each other when the going gets tough?&quot;</p>
