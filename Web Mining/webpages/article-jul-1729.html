		<h2>Wenger steps up row</h2>
					<b>Wenger steps up row</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Arsene Wenger has stepped up his feud with Sir Alex Ferguson by claiming the Manchester United manager is guilty of bringing football into disrepute.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The pair&#x27;s long-running row was put back in the headlines on Saturday when Ferguson said his Arsenal counterpart was &quot;a disgrace&quot;. Wenger initially refused to bite back, saying only: &quot;I will never answer any questions any more about this man.&quot; But now he claims Ferguson should be punished by the Football Association. The latest twist in the Ferguson-Wenger saga came on Saturday when the United boss, in an interview with The Independent newspaper, discussed the events after the game between the two sides in October. United won 2-0 that day, at Old Trafford, but the game was followed by a now notorious food fight which saw Ferguson&#x27;s clothes covered in soup and pizza. The sides meet again at Highbury on 1 February. &quot;In the tunnel Wenger was criticising my players, calling them cheats, so I told him to leave them alone and behave himself,&quot; Ferguson said on Saturday. &quot;He ran at me with hands raised saying &#x27;what do you want to do about it?&#x27; &quot;To not apologise for the behaviour of the players to another manager is unthinkable. It&#x27;s a disgrace, but I don&#x27;t expect Wenger to ever apologise, he&#x27;s that type of person.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Those allegations were put to Wenger after Saturday&#x27;s game at Bolton, which Arsenal lost to slip 10 points behind Chelsea in the title race. At first he said only: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been consistent with that story and told you nothing happened. &quot;If he has to talk, he talks. If he wants to make a newspaper article, he makes a newspaper article. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t interest me and doesn&#x27;t matter to me at all. I will never answer to any provocation from him any more. &quot;He does what he likes in England anyway. He can go abroad one day and see how it is.&quot; But later on Saturday, according to The Independent, Wenger spoke to a smaller group of reporters and expanded on his reaction. &quot;I have no diplomatic relations with him,&quot; the Arsenal boss is quoted as saying. &quot;What I don&#x27;t understand is that he does what he wants and you (the press) are all at his feet.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>&quot;The situation (concerning the food fight) has been judged and there is a game going on in a month. &quot;The managers have a responsibility to protect the game before the game. But in England you are only punished for what you say after the game. &quot;Now the whole story starts again. I don&#x27;t go into that game. We play football. I am a football manager and I love football above all ... no matter what people say.&quot; Reminded that Ferguson called him &quot;a disgrace&quot;, Wenger added: &quot;I don&#x27;t respond to anything. In England you have a good phrase. It is &#x27;bringing the game into disrepute&#x27;. &quot;But that is not only after a game, it is as well before a game.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ferguson had also claimed that United chief executive David Gill and Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein had agreed at boardroom level not to discuss the incident in public. But Ferguson added: &quot;In the ensuing weeks all you got was a diatribe from Arsenal about being kicked off the pitch and all that nonsense. Gill phoned Dein three times to complain but nothing was done. &quot;The return is on 1 February and they will come out with another diatribe. &quot;David Gill and I feel we should set the record straight because Arsenal have not written to us to apologise and we would not let that happen here.&quot; Meanwhile, the League Managers Association have offered to act as peacemakers in the hope of resolving the on-going row. During that stormy game in October, United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy caught Arsenal&#x27;s Ashley Cole with one particularly strong tackle. Wenger later accused Van Nistelrooy of &quot;cheating&quot; and was fined Â£15,000 and &quot;severely reprimanded&quot; by the Football Association. Ferguson admitted on Saturday that Van Nistelrooy&#x27;s tackle, which earned the Dutchman a ban, &quot;could have given (Cole) a serious injury&quot;, but he believes Arsenal were the main aggressors.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Wenger is always complaining the match was not played in the right spirit,&quot; he added. &quot;They are the worst losers of all time, they don&#x27;t know how to lose. Maybe it is just Manchester United, they don&#x27;t lose many games to other teams. &quot;We tend to forget the worst disciplinary record of all time was Arsenal&#x27;s up until last season. In fairness it has improved and now they are seen as paragons of virtue. &quot;But to Wenger it never happens, it is all some dream or nightmare.&quot;</p>
