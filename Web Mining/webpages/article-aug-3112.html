		<h2>Lewis-Francis turns to Christie</h2>
					<b>Lewis-Francis turns to Christie</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Mark Lewis-Francis has stepped up his preparations for the new season by taking advice from British sprint icon Linford Christie.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The 22-year-old is set to compete at Sheffield this weekend and will then take on Maurice Greene and Kim Collins in Birmingham on 18 February. &quot;Training in <i>Wales</i> and getting advice from Linford Christie is broadening my mind,&quot; said Lewis-Francis. The sprinter has also shed weight since winning relay gold at the Athens Games. &quot;Last year I was 91kg, now I am 86.9kg - hopefully my times will come down,&quot; he said. &quot;This has been brought about by eating the right foods and cutting out the snacks. It is just discipline and being more focused about what I am doing.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;I am still keeping up my weights work and I can see the improvement in my running.&quot; Despite playing his part in Britain&#x27;s successful 4x100m relay team, Lewis-Francis still feels the frustration of missing out on the individual 100m final at the 2004 Olympics. &quot;That was heartbreaking, but I had made it to the semi-final and for me, on a personal level, that was an achievement. &quot;I just have to be patient and build up for the next Olympics. That is my goal and whatever I do between now and then will be geared to making the final.&quot;</p>
