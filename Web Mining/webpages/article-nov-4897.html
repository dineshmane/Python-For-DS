					<p>IMF &#x27;cuts&#x27; German growth estimate</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The International Monetary Fund is to cut its 2005 growth forecast for the German economy from 1.8% to 0.8%, the Financial Times Deutschland reported.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The IMF will also reduce its growth estimate for the 12-member eurozone economy from 2.2% to 1.6%, the newspaper reported. The German economy has been faltering, with unemployment levels rising to a seventy-year high of 5.2 million. Its sluggish performance continues to hamper the entire eurozone.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The IMF&#x27;s draft World Economic Outlook - due to be published in April - would point to a marked deterioration in Germany&#x27;s economy, the FT report said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>In September, the IMF had said that German growth for the current year would be 1.8%. The IMF has also revised eurozone forecasts, the paper said, taking into account high oil prices, the strength of the euro and weak demand in many of the world&#x27;s leading economies. Europe&#x27;s economic difficulties have been highlighted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which argued in a report published on Tuesday that the continent could only achieve US living standards by freeing up its labour markets. &quot;The eurozone does not look like it has a self-sustaining recovery,&quot; James Carrick, an economist with ABN Amro, told the newspaper. &quot;It is too dependant on the rest of the world.&quot;</p>
