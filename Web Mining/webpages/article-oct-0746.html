		<h2>Sculthorpe wants Lions captaincy</h2>
					<p>Sculthorpe wants Lions captaincy</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Paul Sculthorpe has admitted he would love to succeed Andy Farrell as Great Britain skipper if the Wigan star does switch codes to rugby union.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Sculthorpe was vice-captain in the Tri-Nations, and took the St Helens captaincy from Chris Joynt last year. &quot;I would definitely want the job - I make no bones about it,&quot; Sculthorpe told Online News Sport. &quot;It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve always wanted to do. I&#x27;d gladly take it if it was offered to me.&quot;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 27-year-old, who captained St Helens to Challenge Cup success last year, said following in the footsteps of Farrell would be a challenge. &quot;Andy would be a hard act to follow but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m confident of being up to,&quot; he said. &quot;The GB team isn&#x27;t a one-man team. There are a lot of good young players who are pushing for places anyway.&quot;</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Sculthorpe said the rugby league world would understand if Farrell did decide to move to rugby union. &quot;It&#x27;s a short career and you have to make of it what you can,&quot; said Sculthorpe. &quot;Nobody can blame him if he does go - he&#x27;s done everything in the game of rugby league.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Financially it could set him up for life. If he fancies a new challenge, then who could fault him?&quot; Sculthorpe also called on the rugby league authorities to have a serious look at the number of games the top players are being asked to play. Sean Long, Sculthorpe&#x27;s Saints and Lions team-mate, has expressed doubts about his international future &quot;I think Sean&#x27;s situation is to do with the sheer number of games we&#x27;re playing,&quot; he said.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The way he&#x27;s looking at it is that if he can extend his career by a couple of years by not playing international rugby, then he&#x27;s willing to do that. &quot;The RFL has got to do something about the fixtures. We&#x27;re playing 42 weeks of the year and it&#x27;s too much. &quot;A lot of the niggly injuries that I&#x27;ve suffered with over the last couple of years have come about because of the lack of rest time.&quot; St Helens have been strongly linked with a move for brilliant young forward Sonny Bill Williams, and Sculthorpe said he would love the 19-year-old to come to Knowsley Road. &quot;He&#x27;s a great player - a big strong lad who can certainly hit hard in defence, but who is also very skilful,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;d love him to come to St Helens. Who knows what might happen? But you want the best players in your team, and he&#x27;s certainly one of the best players in the world.&quot;</p>
