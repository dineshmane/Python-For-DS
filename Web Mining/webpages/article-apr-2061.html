					<p>Minister digs in over doping row</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The Belgian sports minister at the centre of the Svetlana Kuznetsova doping row says he will not apologise for making allegations against her.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Claude Eerdekens claims the US Open champion tested positive for ephedrine at an exhibition event last month. Criticised for making the announcement, he said: &quot;I will never apologise. This product is banned and it&#x27;s up to her to explain why it&#x27;s there.&quot; Kuznetsova says the stimulant may have been in a cold remedy she took. The Russian said she did nothing wrong by taking the medicine during the event. The Women&#x27;s Tennis Association cleared Kuznetsova of any offence because the drug is not banned when taken out of competition.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Eerdekens said he made the statement in order to protect the other three players that took part in the tournament, Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne, Nathalie Dechy of France and Russia&#x27;s Elena Dementieva. But Dechy is fuming that she has been implicated in the row. &quot;How can you be happy when you see your face on the cover page and talking about doping?&quot; Dechy said. &quot;I&#x27;m really upset about it and I think the Belgian government did a really bad job about this. &quot;I think we deserve an apology from the guy. You cannot say anything like this - you cannot say some stuff like this, saying it&#x27;s one of these girls. This is terrible.&quot; Dementieva is also angry and says that Dechy and herself are the real victims of the scandal. &quot;You have no idea what I have been through all these days. It&#x27;s been too hard on me,&quot; she said. &quot;The WTA are trying to handle this problem by saying there are three victims, but I see only two victims in this story - me and Nathalie Dechy, who really have nothing to do with this. &quot;To be honest with you, I don&#x27;t feel like I want to talk to Sveta at all. I&#x27;m just very upset with the way everything has happened.&quot;</p>
