					<p>Johnson accuses British sprinters</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Former Olympic champion Michael Johnson has accused Britain&#x27;s top sprinters of lacking pride and ambition.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;At the moment, the biggest factor on the mind of British sprinters is to be number one in Britain,&quot; the world 200m and 400m record holder told Five Live. &quot;Athletics at the moment is all about international competitions and they need to show a little more pride.&quot; However, Linford Christie countered: &quot;It&#x27;s easy to criticise when you haven&#x27;t gone through the system here.&quot; Johnson was involved in a verbal spat with Britain&#x27;s Darren Campbell earlier this year. The American had cast doubt on Campbell&#x27;s claims he had torn a hamstring in the wake of his failure to reach the Olympic 100m and 200m finals.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>And the American remains highly critical of aspects of British sprinting. &quot;The only time you see British sprinters getting upset or riled is when there is a debate as to which one is better than the other,&quot; he claimed. &quot;Athletes here have to compete more outside the UK. Their focus has to be on being the best in the world and not just on being the top British sprinter.&quot; Speaking at an elite coaches&#x27; conference in Birmingham, Johnson also argued that although there has been more investment in the sport in Britain, it had not necessarily reaped the rewards. &quot;You can&#x27;t fix everything with money,&quot; he admitted. &quot;You contrast the situation here to that of some US athletes who have no funding. &quot;Those who aren&#x27;t funded might be hungrier and more motivated because their road to success is a lot more difficult and challenging. &quot;So when they get to the top they are more appreciative.&quot;</p>
