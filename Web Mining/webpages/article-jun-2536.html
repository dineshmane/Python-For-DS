		<h2>Shares hit by MS drug suspension</h2>
					<p>Shares hit by MS drug suspension</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Shares in Elan and Biogen Idec plunged on Monday as the firms suspended sales of new multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri after a patient&#x27;s death in the US.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>On the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Ireland-based Elan lost 70% while US partner Biogen Idec shed 43%. The firms took action after the death from a central nervous system disease and a suspected case of the condition. The cases cited involved the use of both Tysabri and Avonex, Biogen Idec&#x27;s existing multiple sclerosis drug. The companies said they have no reports of the rare condition - progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) - in patients taking either Tysabri or Avonex alone. Tysabri was approved for use in the US last November and was widely tipped to become the world&#x27;s leading multiple sclerosis treatment.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;The companies will work with clinical investigators to evaluate Tysabri-treated patients and will consult with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of PML,&quot; the two firms said in a statement. &quot;The outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re-initiation of dosing in clinical trials and future commercial availability.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Analysts had believed the product would provide a new growth opportunity for Biogen Idec, which had faced increased competition from rivals to Avonex. Elan, once the biggest firm on the Irish stock exchange, was also expected to receive a boost, from the new product. An inquiry into Elan&#x27;s accounts in 2002 brought the group close to bankruptcy but the firm has been rebuilding itself since, with its share price increasing by almost four-fold last year. &quot;Most of the value in the company was in Tysabri,&quot; said Ian Hunter at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin. &quot;Now there&#x27;s a question mark over it.&quot; Elan finished down $18.90 at $8, while Biogen fell $28.63 to $38.65.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>- Shares in UK pharmaceutical firm Phytopharm closed down 19.84% at 151.5 pence on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, after it said a partner was set to pull out of a deal on an experimental Alzheimer&#x27;s disease treatment. Phytopharm said Japan&#x27;s Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical was likely to end a licensing agreement, prompting analysts to raise questions over the level of its future cash reserves.</p>
