					<p>Tech helps disabled speed demons</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>An organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport, which is now increasingly possible thanks to technological innovations.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>The Motorsport Endeavour Club left the starting grid yesterday at the Autosport International 2005 show at Birmingham&#x27;s NEC, with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Motorcycle racer, Roy Tansley, from Derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated. &quot;I needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg,&quot; Mr Tansley told the Online News News website. &quot;In simple terms, I needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a Heath Robinson device.&quot; Mr Tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing&#x27;s governing body, the Autocycle Union. &quot;At that time they wouldn&#x27;t let any amputee race at all, but eventually they told me I could have a licence as long as I raced sidecars.&quot; Mr Tansley&#x27;s invention, the Pro-Shift, is designed to work with Hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing. In addition to helping disabled riders to compete, Mr Tansley reckons that the Pro-Shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the Isle of Man TT. As a result, there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance. &quot;I&#x27;m not prejudiced, I&#x27;ll sell to able-bodied people if I have to!&quot; he joked.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Another exhibit on the Motorsport Endeavour stand is a Subaru Impreza rally car, adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. The vehicle belongs to ParaRallying, the world&#x27;s only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in Lincolnshire.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;We use the latest technology supplied by an Italian company,&quot; said rally driver Dave Hawkins who runs the company. &quot;The cars have electronic throttles, electronic brakes, electronic clutches - we&#x27;ve yet to turn anybody away.&quot; Mr Hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees, quadriplegics, people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated. ParaRallying uses a Vauxhall Astra GSI with an automatic gearbox and manual Subaru Imprezas. The car on display is fitted with a &#x27;duck clutch&#x27; - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. It also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>When Joy Rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father, Murray, is a former Australian Formula 3 champion.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>And it was Rainey Senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter&#x27;s small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs. She uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals, a cushion behind her back and raising the seat. &quot;But in a competition car you have to have everything right or you&#x27;ll lose the balance of the car,&quot; she said. &quot;I bring everything back to me - steering wheel, steering column, gear lever and pedals.&quot; When she recently took part in the London to Sydney Marathon she shared the driving with her partner, Trevor, who now does the engineering work. He designed a system for their Morris Minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute. The Motorsport Endeavour Club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level.</p>
