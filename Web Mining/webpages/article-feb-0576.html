		<h2>Wilkinson to miss Ireland match</h2>
					<p>Wilkinson to miss <i>Ireland</i> match</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>England will have to take on <i>Ireland</i> in the Six Nations without captain and goal-kicker Jonny Wilkinson, according to his Newcastle boss Rob Andrew.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Wilkinson - who had targeted the 27 February match for his international comeback - has been missed by England, not least for his goal-kicking. &quot;Jonny&#x27;s not fit yet,&quot; Falcons chief Andrew told Online News Radio Five Live. &quot;He won&#x27;t be fit for Dublin, there&#x27;s no doubt about that, but he might be fit for <i>Scotland</i> and Italy.&quot; The 25-year-old has not played for <i>England</i> since the 2003 World Cup final after a succession of injuries. England, who have lost three Six Nations games in a row, wasted a 17-6 half-time lead in their 18-17 defeat to France. Goal-kickers Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley missed six penalty attempts and a drop-goal between them. &quot;They&#x27;ve probably got two of the best English kickers in the Premiership in Hodgson and Barkley,&quot; added Andrew, a former <i>England</i> fly-half and goal-kicker.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;They&#x27;re both pretty good kickers. Charlie is a good kicker week-in, week-out. &quot;But it&#x27;s all about pressure and unfortunately <i>England</i> are just not handling the pressure at the moment.&quot; Andrew also blamed England&#x27;s poor run of recent results on a lack of leadership in the side following several high-profile retirements and injuries. &quot;They just didn&#x27;t have that leadership that would have seen them through. Martin Johnson, Lawrence Dallaglio and Jonny are obviously huge losses and leadership is so important in those situations,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it is really difficult for Jason Robinson to lead the side effectively from full-back.&quot; Meanwhile, former <i>England</i> full-back Dusty Hare put England&#x27;s mistakes down to a lack of mental toughness.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Jonny Wilkinson has proved himself a cool customer with around an 80% kicking success rate,&quot; Hare told Online News Radio Five Live. &quot;But natural-born toughness comes into it as well as all the practice you do. &quot;You have to be able to shut out all the outside elements and concentrate on putting the ball between the posts.&quot; Hodgson, who has an excellent kicking record with club side Sale Sharks, has introduced crowd noise into his practice routine of late. &quot;The top golfers don&#x27;t hit the fairway every time, and it is the same with goal-kicking,&quot; Hare added. &quot;You need that mental toughness as well to put the ball over, but great goal-kickers like Jonny Wilkinson come along very rarely.&quot;</p>
