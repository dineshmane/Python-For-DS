		<h2>Warning over US pensions deficit</h2>
					<b>Warning over US pensions deficit</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Taxpayers may have to bail out the US agency that protects workers&#x27; pension funds, leading economists have warned.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>With the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) some £23bn (£12m) in deficit, the Financial Economists Roundtable (FER) wants Congress to act. Instead of taxpayers having to pick up the bill, the FER wants Congressmen to change the PBGC&#x27;s funding rules. The FER says firms should not have been allowed to reduce the insurance premiums they pay into the PBGC fund. The FER blames this on a 2004 law, in a statement signed by several members, who include Nobel economics laureate William Sharpe. It said it was &quot;dismayed&quot; at the situation and wants Congress to overturn the legislation.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Cash-strapped US companies, including those in the airline, car-making and steel industries, had argued in favour of the 2004 rule change, claiming that funding the insurance premiums adequately would force them to have to cut jobs. &quot;With a little firmer hand on the pensions issues in the US, I think that Congress could avoid having to turn to the taxpayer and instead turn the obligations back onto the companies that deserve to pay them,&quot; said Professor Dennis Logue, dean of Price College of Business at the University of Oklahoma. The PBGC was founded in 1974 to protect workers&#x27; retirement rights. Its most recent action came last week when it took control of the pilots&#x27; pension scheme at United Airlines. With United battling bankruptcy, the carrier had wanted to use the money set aside for pensions to finance running costs. The company has an estimated $2.9bn hole in its pilots&#x27; pension scheme, which the PBGC will now guarantee.</p>
