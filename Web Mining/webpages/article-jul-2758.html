					<b>Ajax refuse to rule out Jol move</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Ajax have refused to reveal whether Tottenham&#x27;s boss Martin Jol is on the Dutch champions&#x27; shortlist to become the Amsterdam club&#x27;s new coach.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>Jol, who has coached in his native Holland, has guided Spurs to the Premiership&#x27;s top eight. An Ajax spokesman told Online News Sport: &quot;The coach must fit our profile - a coach who understands the Dutch league and offensive and distinctive football. &quot;We need to find a solution soon, so someone is in place for next season.&quot; Ronald Koeman quit as Ajax boss last week after their exit from the Uefa Cup. Jol has been linked with the vacant post at Ajax, with reports saying he has fallen out with Spurs&#x27; sporting director Frank Arnesen. But in a statement on Spurs&#x27; website, Jol said: &quot;I&#x27;m happy here, I&#x27;m not in discussion with anyone else, I don&#x27;t want to go elsewhere.&quot; Ajax have enlisted the help of Dutch legend Johann Cruyff, currently a consultant at Barcelona, to help find a new head coach. Cruyff has admitted he has been impressed by the way former RFC Waalwijk coach Jol has turned round Spurs&#x27; fortunes since taking over from Jacques Santini. Tonny Bruins Slot and Ruud Krol are currently in charge of Ajax, who are third in the Dutch league.</p>
