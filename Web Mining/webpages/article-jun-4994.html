					<p>Mourinho takes swipe at Arsenal</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has attempted to pile the pressure on title rivals Arsenal ahead of the Gunners facing Newcastle on Wednesday.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Arsenal will play the Magpies a day after Chelsea beat Portsmouth during a busy festive programme. And Mourinho said: &quot;They always seem to have two or three days&#x27; rest in which to recover. Perhaps it&#x27;s something to do with the television schedule. &quot;All my players are tired, especially John Terry.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho admitted his side were &quot;lucky&quot; to win at Fratton Park but is still unhappy with the amount of games in such a short space of time during this time of year. He added: &quot;We have had to play two matches in three days which is foreign to many of my players and, although I understand the traditions of football here at this time of year, it is not good for your health to do it.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>&quot;You can sit back and smoke cigars, one after another, and it is a good life, but it is not actually good for you. &quot;Playing so many games is certainly not healthy, especially for teams who still have European commitment.&quot;</p>
