<font></font>			<p>The Welsh Rugby Union wants to restructure the Northern Hemisphere season into four separate blocks.</p>
			<p></p>
<font></font>			<p>The season would start with the Celtic League in October, followed by the Heineken Cup in February and March, and the Six Nations moved to April and May. After a nine week break, the WRU then proposes a two-month period of away and home international matches. WRU chairman David Pickering said the structure would end problems of player availability for club and country. He added: &quot;We feel sure that spectator interest would respond to the impetus of high intensity rugby being played continuously rather than the fragmented timetable currently in operation. &quot;Equally, we suspect that the sponsors would prefer the sustained interest in a continuous tournament and hopefully, the broadcasters would also enjoy increased exposure.&quot; Moving the Six Nations from its traditional February beginning should also ensure better weather conditions and &quot;stimulate greater interest in the games and generally provide increased skills and competition and attract greater spectator viewing&quot;, Pickering argued. The plan will be put before the International Rugby Board next month, where four other plans drawn up by independent consultants for a global integrated season will also be discussed. Pickering added: &quot;It&#x27;s very early days and there are a number of caveats associated with it - not least the revenue from the broadcasters, which is extremely important. &quot;We&#x27;ve got a good plan and one which should be judged on its merits.&quot;</p>
