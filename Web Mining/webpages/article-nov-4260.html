			<p></p>
			<p>Chelsea&#x27;s William Gallas believes they will battle it out with Arsenal for the Premiership in the coming months.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;It&#x27;ll be a two-horse race all the way to the end of the season because we are both going to give it everything,&quot; he told Online News Sport. &quot;You need to be good and you need a lot of luck. You need a bit of both but it will be as hard for the Arsenal players as it is for the Chelsea boys.&quot; &quot;We know that we have got the power in our hands just now,&quot; added Gallas.</p>
			<span></span>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;But you never know what is going to happen in football - two seasons ago Manchester United picked up so many points towards the end of the season when they won the title. &quot;Obviously, nobody at Chelsea wants to come second but you never know what happens in football. &quot;We will be challenging to come first as much as every Arsenal player will be challenging to come first.&quot; Gallas has been given extra confidence by the impact manager Jose Mourinho has had since taking over as manager during the summer.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>And the French international defender believes Mourinho is perfectly suited to boss the squad of Chelsea stars and says his managerial expertise will prevent any player revolt. &quot;It&#x27;s only normal when you have got a team put together of such big names that you put the finishing touch to it and the finishing touch at Chelsea is a fantastic manager like Mourinho,&quot; he said. &quot;He is the icing on the cake at the club. He has this fantastic knack of thinking of everything. &quot;Another incredible quality that Mourinho has is that every player, even though the fans may consider them to be a stars, within the dressing-room they are absolutely equal. &quot;Mourinho reminds everyone but he doesn&#x27;t have to because he has created a wonderful atmosphere where everybody is playing and laughing every day. &quot;It is a changed dressing-room from the atmosphere there was last year.&quot;</p>
