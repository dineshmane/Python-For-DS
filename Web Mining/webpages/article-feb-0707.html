					<b>Stuart joins Norwich from Addicks</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Norwich have signed Charlton midfielder Graham Stuart until the end of the season for an undisclosed fee.</p>
<font></font>			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;It was a very easy decision to make,&quot; the 34-year-old told Norwich&#x27;s website. &quot;The attraction for me was to continue to play in the Premiership.&quot; Canaries boss Nigel Worthington added: &quot;I&#x27;m delighted that Graham will be joining us until the end of the season. &quot;He&#x27;s gives us a wealth of experience. Hopefully, he can be part of keeping us in the Premier League.&quot; Stuart has extensive top-flight experience with Everton, Chelsea and Charlton and can play across the midfield positions. He joins Norwich with the Norfolk club second-from-bottom in the Premiership, but Stuart is confident that the Carrow Road outfit have a bright future. &quot;I&#x27;ve been very impressed with the facilities here. It&#x27;s obviously a very well run football club with excellent facilities and I&#x27;ve always enjoyed playing at Carrow Road,&quot; he added. &quot;It&#x27;s a nice compact ground with a good atmosphere and hopefully I can help give the fans something else to cheer.&quot;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Stuart, a former England Under-21 international, made 110 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 18 goals, before joining Everton. He won the FA Cup with the Toffees in 1995 and remains a hero at Goodison Park after his 81st-minute winner against Wimbledon saved Everton from relegation in 1994. Stuart spent just over four years at Goodison Park, making 125 senior appearances and scoring 25 goals, before signing for Sheffield United - where he scored 12 goals in 68 appearances. After signing for Charlton he made 164 appearances, scoring 23 times, but recently he has been battling a back problem and had not played for the Londoners for three months before heading to Norwich.</p>
