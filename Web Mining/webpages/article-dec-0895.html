					<b>Absa and Barclays talks continue</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>South Africa biggest retail bank Absa has said it is still in talks with UK bank Barclays over the sale of majority stake in the group.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>In November, Absa said it was close to striking a deal with Barclays. But the group said Barclays is still waiting for the approval of South Africa&#x27;s banking and competition authorities to make a formal offer. Absa also announced that it expects to see earnings grow by 20-25% in its current financial year.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;Discussions with Barclays are continuing, but shareholders are advised that no agreement has been reached as to any offer being made by Barclays to acquire a majority stake in Absa,&quot; Absa said in a statement. If Barclays buys a stake in Absa it will be one of the largest foreign investments in South Africa in recent years. Absa currently has a market value of about $8.5bn (Â£4.4bn). Analysts said Absa&#x27;s earnings forecast was better than expected. However, the company warned that headline earnings growth would be trimmed by about four percentage points because of share options for a black economic empowerment transaction and a staff share incentive scheme. The South African group will release its results for the year to 31 March on 30 May.</p>
