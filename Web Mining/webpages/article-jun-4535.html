					<p>Iraq and Afghanistan in WTO talks</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is to hold membership talks with both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But Iran&#x27;s bid to join the trade body has been refused after the US blocked its application for the 21st time. The countries stand to reap huge benefits from membership of the group, whose purpose is to promote free trade. Joining, however, is a lengthy process. China&#x27;s admission in 2001 took 15 years and talks with Russia and Saudi Arabia have been taking place for 10 years. Membership of the Geneva-based WTO helps guarantee a country&#x27;s goods receives equal treatment in the markets of other member states - a policy which has seen it become closely associated with globalisation.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Iraq&#x27;s Trade Minister Mohammed Mustafa al-Jibouri welcomed the move, describing it as significant as November&#x27;s decision by the Paris Club of creditor nations to write off 80% of the country&#x27;s debts. Assad Omar, Afghanistan&#x27;s envoy to the United Nations in Geneva, said accession would contribute to &quot;regional prosperity and global security&quot;. There are now 27 countries seeking membership of the WTO. Prospective members need to enter into negotiations with potential trading countries and change domestic laws to bring them in line with WTO regulations. Before the process gets under way, all 148 WTO members must give their backing to applicant countries. The US said it could not approve Iran&#x27;s application because it is currently reviewing relations. But several nations criticised the approach, and European Union ambassador to the WTO, Carlo Trojan, said Iran&#x27;s application &quot;must be treated independently of political issues&quot;.</p>
