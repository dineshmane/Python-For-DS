					<p>Tomlinson stays focused on Europe</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Long jumper Chris Tomlinson has cut his schedule to ensure he is fully fit for the European Indoor Championships.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The 23-year-old has a minor injury and has pulled out of international meets in Madrid and Lievin this week as well as warm-weather training in Lanzarote. &quot;It&#x27;s nothing serious,&quot; said his coach Peter Stanley. &quot;He strained a muscle in his abdomen at the Birmingham meeting but is back in full training.&quot; Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis will also not compete in Madrid on Thursday. The Birmingham athlete, who clocked a season&#x27;s best of 6.61 seconds over 60m in Birmingham last week, also prefers to focus his attentions on next month&#x27;s European Indoor Championships.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Lewis-Francis, who was runner-up to British team-mate Jason Gardener at the Europeans three years ago, will continue his training at home. Meanwhile, Tomlinson is still searching for this first major medal and this season he has shown he could be in the sort of form to grab a spot on the podium in Madrid. The Middlesbrough athlete jumped a season&#x27;s best of 7.95m at the Birmingham Grand Prix - good enough to push world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow into second.</p>
