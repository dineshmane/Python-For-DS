		<h2>Honour for UK games maker</h2>
					<b>Honour for UK games maker</b><br><br>
			<p></p>
			<p>Leading British computer games maker Peter Molyneux has been made an OBE in the New Year Honours list.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The head of Surrey&#x27;s Lionhead Studios was granted the honour for services to the computer games industry. Mr Molyneux has been behind many of the ground-breaking games of the last 15 years such as Populous, Theme Park, Dungeon Keeper and Black and White. He is widely credited with helping to create and popularise the so-called god-game genre.</p>
			<p></p>
			<span></span>
			<p>Speaking to the Online News News website Mr Molyneux said receiving the honour was something of a surprise. It&#x27;s come completely out of the blue,&quot; he said, &quot;I never would have guessed that I&#x27;d have that kind of honour.&quot; He said he was surprised as much because, not too long ago, many people thought computer gaming was a fad.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>&quot;It was thought to be like skateboarding,&quot; he said, &quot;a craze that everyone thought would go away.&quot; Now, he said, the gaming world rivals the movie industry for sales and cultural influence. &quot;Britain plays a big part in it,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#x27;s one of the founding nations that made the industry what it is.&quot; Mr Molyneux has been a pivotal figure in the computer games industry for almost 20 years. His career started at Bullfrog Studios which in 1987 produced Populous one of the first God-games. The title gave players control over the lives a small population of computerised people. Mr Molyneux said that his involvement with the games industry started almost by accident as back in the early days game making was more a hobby than a career. &quot;I thought everyone would treat Populous as weird,&quot; he said, &quot;but it became a huge international success.&quot; He left Bullfrog in 1997 to set up Lionhead Studios which was behind the ambitous and widely acclaimed game Black &amp; White. One of the next titles to come from Lionhead puts players in charge of a movie studio and tasks them with producing and directing a hit film. The veteran game maker says he has one problem still to solve. &quot;Being an absolute geek I&#x27;ve got no idea what I&#x27;m going to wear when I go and pick it up,&quot; he said.</p>
